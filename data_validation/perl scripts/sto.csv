Donatra held onto the reins of power of the military and kept much of her forces safely off-world in case the peace didn't hold.

But rumors of her possible involvement in the plot to assassinate Tal'aura dogged her campaign, and when Donatra declined to endorse Sela's campaign her defeat was almost assured.

While Sela opposed the plan, which she saw as rewarding the Remans for a violent uprising, she and Praetor Chulan did not have the strength to oppose Donatra's power.

The physical strength of the Remans, as well as their supplies of dilithium and heavy metals, added to Donatra's formidable military strength, and she had the resources to reopen shipyards and munitions plants closed since Shinzon's revolt. As resources flowed back to Romulus from Remus and the worlds Donatra controlled, energy rationing and food lines became a thing of the past.

The Romulan Senate was reluctant to deal with the Remans but was swayed by popular support for Donatra, and the senators reluctantly vote to allow Xiomek to take a seat in the Sentate and to extend citizenship to the Remans. In common practice, however, most Romulans continued to treat Remans as second-class citizens, and the Remans were reluctant to relocate to Romulan settlements."

What one world welcomed, another saw as false friendship or even an act of war.
