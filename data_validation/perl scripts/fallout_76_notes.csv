Be prepared for typical kinds of inclement weather, including high winds and rain. Print and laminate a detailed 10-day weather report as close to leaving as possible. Make sure your sleeping bags, jackets and underwear are all rated for the climate.  Be sure to have appropriate layers.\n\n\n\nTENTS - Choose an appropriate tent for the location and duration of your stay and the number of people that are going to be there. Camping in tents assume a close fit so make sure you're buddied up with someone you're comfortable with. Generally you can use a 3-season tent, but if you're planning on camping in the snow or at altitude you make need to bring a 4-season tent.  Don't forget a repair kit, $8 can save you from a miserable night if rain seeps in through a hole.\n\n\n\nSITING - make sure you choose an appropriate site.  If you can, pitch your tents on wooden frames to get you off of the ground.  If that's not possible, look for a durable surface like rock, bare ground, or gravel.  Camp at least 200 feet from water and make sure you aren't downstream to avoid flooding. Look for a well shaded area to reduce temperature fluctuations, and don't forget to look up! Pitching your tent under a dead tree branch or near a rock slide can result in potential disaster.\n\n\n\nWASTE MANAGEMENT - make sure you have bags to pack out human waste, toilet paper and other sanitary materials.""}]"

However, Head Doctor Kessle and other hospital administrators have yet to be brought up on any charges as a result. While Tarquin's expose for the Charleston Herald will not soon be forgotten by our readers, much like Nellie Bly's historic investigation of the Women's Lunatic Asylum of Blackwell's Island, it seems that policymakers and officials have wiped their hands of the situation.\n\n\n\nMiss Eleanor's diagnosis should bring to light the possibility that many of the asylum patients may have been misdiagnosed and institutionalized without significant presence of mental health issues. She reported that patients were kept restrained for long periods of time in tight confines with other patients. They had breaks from this imprisonment only for treatment, meals, and sleep. Treatment, as described in the original article, was largely forcing patients to be immersed in ice cold water. Basic needs were fulfilled at the lowest possible criteria, with no process for patients to request humane accommodations for things like vegetarian meal plans or additional blankets.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, her editor had to file multiple times for her release from the institution into his care. This might mean that family members who were willing or able to care for relatives in the facility were left in the cold because they were unable to pay for fees associated with the release procedure.  The intent of Miss Eleanor's assignment was to remain in the facility for ten days, but even with aggressively documented and funded attempts to release her, she remained in the facility for a month.\n\n\n\nOf course, the startling thing about this case for me was that any interested individual could pay the hospital for a guided tour of the facility. Ostensibly this was intended for doctors and health professionals, but as Miss Eleanor reported and was later confirmed by staff, this was not always the case. Family members were not allowed to visit patients unless they could pay for this expensive and secretive \""Lunatic Tourism\"" offering, and there was no guarantee that they would be able to see their family member without paying additional fees.\n\n\n\nSo now the Asylum is closing, and the inmates are being freed. Most of them will end up with family, in other hospitals like Watoga's state of the art facilities, or in halfway houses. However, some of them have no prospect other than adding to the already high amounts of homeless, itinerant workers in the region. The stigma that these patients feel already is huge, because while few of them were sent to Allegheny as violent offenders, we hear endless media coverage about the threat that these patients pose to the region.\n\n\n\nI think the real threat to this region are the folks who ran that facility, and yet we see them escaping without stigma. They're a resume away from joining your workforce. An application away from becoming part of your community.  Those are the real madmen run amok!""}]"

Blackwell started his public life as a union activist, brokering deals between disenfranchised miners and regional powerhouses like Garrahan Mining and Hornwright Industrial. His star would only continue to rise during his re-election to the United States Senate, winning with a staggering 73% of the popular vote.\n\n\n\nIt would take the Senator's open support of the Appalachian Free States movement, a group of local survivalists with separatist overtones, before his popularity would begin to wane. But as minor scuffles between the Free States and the police broke into open violence, the Senator's support for the Free States only grew, as did calls for his resignation.\n\n\n\nThen, seemingly without warning, the Senator vanished. Calls to his Charleston office and home went unanswered. His daughter, Judith, stopped showing up for classes at VTU. Multiple search parties were organized by police and concerned citizens, but to no end.\n\n\n\nIt was just three days ago that an unaddressed letter came across my desk, offering me an interview with the missing Senator. Presuming it a hoax, I nonetheless accepted.\n\n\n\nBut it was no hoax.\n\n\n\nIn an exclusive interview, I visited with our controversial former Senator in an undisclosed location. I asked Senator Blackwell why it was he left the Senate, presuming the pressure from his constituents had caused him to become disenchanted with public service. But the Senator had a far darker message than I could've ever suspected.\n\n\n\n\""There are sinister forces at work in the halls of government... I simply could not be a part of that anymore.\"" Pressed for details, Blackwell leveled accusations at the highest echelons of power - the US Executive Branch, the Department of Agriculture, major corporations - all complicit in a shadowy conspiracy, and to whom the American citizen, in the Senator's own words, \""are nothing but pawns in their sick games.\""\n\n\n\nHis advice to the American people in the face of such a harrowing claim? \""The only recourse left to the average American is to flee the population centers, head into the wilderness, where one can find at least some hope of escaping the lurid gaze of those in government plotting against us.\"" Throughout our conversation the Senator was composed, lucid, clear in his belief that everything he said, no matter how outlandish, was truth.\n\n\n\nThrough an evening of shocking revelations, perhaps least surprising of all was the Senator's resignation from the United States Senate. \""Consider this interview my personal resignation from this government and this nation.\"" And with that, I was ushered out, left to wonder how much should be taken as ravings or as desperate pleas for the safety of his fellow Americans.""}]"

They are nothing less than an existential threat. If we cannot find a way to defeat them, or at the very least contain them, there's no reason to think they won't spread far and wide, transforming or destroying everything in their path.\n\n\n\nWe don't know nearly enough about the Scorched to develop real tactics. What we know so far mostly amounts to common sense approaches for dealing with any deadly predator. I'll summarize those points below.\n\n\n\nIf you're unforunate enough to encounter a Scorchbeast - likely because it has decided to hunt you - do everything in your power to keep away from it. If you've got a gun and can find an enclosed space to fire from, that's ideal; Scorchbeasts are too big to fit into small spaces.\n\n\n\nRemember that Scorchbeasts emit strong radiation. That, coupled with their powerful bite, should compel you to keep your distance at all costs. If you've got no other choice, you should at least consider using some Rad-X before you engage the creature at close range.\n\n\n\nScorched humans are savage and deadly. While their ability to speak is limited, don't think they are mindless. They retain enough intelligence and memory to use guns and other weapons, and they're hostile to just about everything they perceive as a potential threat.\n\n\n\nFight the Scorched as you would a Raider, albeit one with a deadly plague. Of vital importance is keeping your distance to minimize the risk of infection. Stay in cover when you can, but give ground when you need to. Do not let them get close.\n\n\n\nI know that's not much to go on. There's still so much we don't know about these creatures. Hopefully it'll help at least a little.""}]"

So while arguments for automation in healthcare are certainly compelling for improving the experiences of patients already in care facilities, it absolutely fails to address that this facility was not operating as intended or designed. It is unreasonable to assume that it might be an appropriate poster child for non-automated care.\n\n   Additionally, the comparison of human and robot care methods and results are largely irrelevant for patients who didn't qualify for a move to Watoga's facilities. These patients were discharged en masse with only a perfunctory attempt to contact their living relatives. Hospitals and doctors throughout the region were suddenly overwhelmed with all of the cases that they had quietly swept away over the years, and unsurprisingly some just swept them away again.\n\n   This caused a massive swell in the region's homeless population, so it is a direct result of this callous and indiscriminate policy that there were both criminal justice and public health crises in the region for the following decades. To simply cite that Watogans and their family members were unaffected by the Asylum's closure is to leave the people of the countryside to fend for themselves.

Well I was; I had to leave. What Thorpe did flooding Charleston, that was just wrong. And I know I'm no better - for the most part, I went along with him. I was starving, and Thorpe kept me fed. But no more. A few of the other Cutthroats felt the same and we all agreed to head out on our own.\n\n\n\nSo now we're here. We used to hide around Big Bend's entrance and jump any unfortunate souls trying to use it for passage. It should be okay here; there's wilderness to live off and enough around to scavenge. If need be, we can disappear into the tunnels. Like I said, I don't expect whatever God there is, or anyone for that matter, to see this and forgive me.

Turns out they're some new militia unit - they call themselves the Brotherhood of Steel? Cheesy, but if it means we've got someone watching the other side of the tunnel I can live with it. \n\nThe head of command told me they've set up camp, so they can watch for traffic entering the region. I asked her if she knew about the giant bats in the sky and I was a bit off guard when she confidently stated, \""that's why we're here.\"" \n\nApparently, the giant bats are thanks to some disease or something called \""Scorched,\"" caused by the nukes. It's been infecting everything across Appalachia, including people. But she says that they and the Responders are doing everything they can to fight it.\n\nShe asked if I was familiar with the Responders. I swear I almost swallowed my tongue. It's been five and a half years, but I still think about it. I told her I had heard of them, but my group keeps mostly to ourselves and I'd better head back to my camp.

We'll trade with them, even though 'trading' often ends with them giving us a shipment of supplies and us handing them whatever few weapon parts or tech components we come across. Seems pretty one-sided if you ask me. \n\n\n\nOne trip I asked her why her group is so nice to us - and she tells me they want to make sure my 'community' is doing alright. I thought about that my whole walk home: a community. It's been over ten years and I still think of us as Cutthroats hiding in a hole waiting for the world to end. It made me hopeful.\n\n \n\nThis life isn't the life I imagined while vacationing at Pleasant Valley all those years ago; it's quiet and lonely and difficult. But it's also simple and it can be strangely more peaceful than the chaos of the 'old world'. The life that me and my \""community\"" have made is real. It's ours. I think I can be content with that.\n\n \n\nP.S. My RobCo watch broke, though, so that's unfortunate. How am I going to keep track of time?

They're a lot more dangerous than the rats and dogs we usually encounter. I'm banning the crew from going to the eastern section of the tunnels and setting up a patrol. We don't know much in terms of organized combat, but we can rig enough traps to keep us safe for a long time.

We thought they were crying wolf - get us to lower our guns so they could ambush us - but I could tell they were genuinely frightened. \n\n\n\nBetween the sobs, they managed to tell us that Scorched had reached the mountains and killed most of the remaining survivors. We had a few hours at best before they reached us. We didn't even have time to figure out where we'd go when they attacked. There's just too many. Once they pushed us back into the tunnels I knew it was over. Scorched have been making their way further into the tunnels for months now.\n\n\n\nI always knew that this wouldn't last. I'd been evading my comeuppance for too long. Sooner or later I'd pay for what I've done.

If people could come back from the horrible things we've done; if I could come back from the horrible things I've done. For a couple of years there, I started to believe maybe it was. But it isn't.

The Sundays were living relatively well from their supplies and farming a little plot of land near their house, while our desperate band was reduced to foraging in the swamps and eating anything they could scrounge up. \n\n\n\nWe resented the Sundays' snobbish attitude, they looked down on us like wild animals. When negotiations over food failed, we started raiding the Sundays' field. The Sundays responded by building a wall. They set out lethal traps, we lost some good people. Then, during one late-night raid, someone knocked over a lantern, and the entire field went up in flames. Nearly everyone died in the ensuing fight.  \n\n\n\nThe remnants of our band tried to salvage what we could from the fire. We also tried to break into the Sundays' bunker, to no avail.

For the scouts you are serving, have an easy way to make sure they clean their dishes. Use the three bucket system - A bucket of water to do an initial rinse and scrape food off of, a bucket of soapy water to combat bacteria and a final bucket to rinse off cleaned plates.\n\n\n\nHEALTH - make sure you have calorically dense meals with a good macronutrient distribution. 40% Carbohydrates, 30% Good fats and 30% protein. Avoid prepackaged meals like MREs and try to make your own meals from base sources if possible.\n\n\n\nSCAVENGING - Part of Pioneer Scouting is learning what in the environment is edible and what isn't - \""living off the land\"". If you're not sure, DON'T EAT IT. Consult with your group leader or another scout who has earned the scavenging badge.\n\n\n\nON THE TRAIL - before you leave, make sure you've prepared enough food for twice as long as you intend to be on the trail and that everyone you're traveling this is appropriately kitted out. Easily accessible snacks of nuts and dried fruit as well as easy to consume meals like sandwiches are a staple.\n\n\n\nBE CREATIVE! - share your ideas with other scouts and brainstorm new ways to eat. Carry a small pack of spices like Cumin, Cinnamon, Salt, Pepper and anything else. A little variety in flavor in a hot meal can raise morale in an instant.""}]"

But it's time to go home! Happy Reclamation Day!\n\n\n\nOur motto at Vault-Tec is: \""Prepare for the Future!\"" But, for you, fine citizen: the future is now. \n\n\n\nYou will find in your official Vault-Tec Reclamation Package, a short wilderness survival guide entitled \""Prepare for the Now!\"" which will orient you in these first few days outside of the vault. Consult the book at your earliest convenience (by all means put the guide down and run away if something, or someone, is trying to eat you!)\n\n\n\nIn this helpful tome you will find sage advice on how to:\n\n\n\nEstablish a base camp!\n\nThe rations and stimpaks in your official Vault-Tec survival kit won't last forever. You'll need to become self-sufficient soon. An important first step is finding a safe location to set up a base camp from which you will embark to secure food, water, and other supplies, and which will safeguard and protect the hard earned resources you bring back.\n\n\n\nConstruct a cooking fire!\n\nYou might be accustomed to TV dinners, or cooking decadent meals in a kitchen with all the conveniences modern life had to offer, or perhaps you never learned to put two slices of bread together before the world ended, either way, you'll need to learn to cook a hot meal from scratch. But first, you'll need something to cook it on!\n\n\n\nMake drinking water safe!\n\nThat cool and refreshing looking stream or pond has all the water a recently repatriated survivor could ever need, but drinking from it could make you sick. Very sick, indeed! Always bottle water from the purest sources, and always boil it completely before drinking!\n\n\n\nEat food that won't eat you back!\n\nPlants and animals may have suffered horrifying mutations making it impossible to tell what they once were. But when your supply of rations runs out, you're going to need to eat those things. And even if you think you know what something is, you should never, ever, eat it raw. Raw food will often contain disease causing bacteria and parasites. The only way to be sure you won't make things worse by eating something, is to cook it.\n\n\n\nCraft a healing salve!\n\nLet's face it, life after the world ends is going to get rough at times. At some point you're going to get hurt. If not by a dumb mistake, then by a vicious mutant creature trying to make you it's dinner. But don't fret. By carefully inspecting the plants around you, you will be able to create old fashion healing remedies that cure itches, sooth burns, and promote healing. You'll want a few doses of salve on hand in case of emergencies.\n\n\n\nWhile challenging, these are the most important first lessons of living in our - your! - new world! Keep trying, and don't give up!\n\n\n\nAnd if it ever seems like things are impossible and all hope is lost, just remember that you earned a place in Vault 76 because Vault-Tec's proprietary genetic testing and carefully crafted aptitude surveys demonstrated your excellence and worthiness to repopulate the earth.  We humans survived through the darkest of ages. And you, dear survivor, are among the best and brightest humanity has to offer.\n\n\n\nGood luck out there! Stay safe. Stay happy.""}]"
