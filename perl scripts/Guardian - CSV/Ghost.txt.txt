Ghosts '','' "In its dying breath, the Traveler created the Ghosts...To seek out those who can wield its\n\nLight as a weapon. Guardians, to protect us, and do what the Traveler itself no longer can."\n\nBuilt from machinery and the Traveler's Light, Ghosts guide their Guardian companions in the quest to reclaim our solar system.\n\nEvery Ghost seeks out its Guardian among the ancient dead. The Ghost serves as scout, librarian, and mechanic, waking ancient machinery and cracking alien codes. In the right situations, a Ghost can even save a Guardian from death.\n\nBut Ghosts are not immortal. As far as Guardians know, every loss is irreplaceable.
 '','' My name is Eriana3, disciple of the Praxic Warlocks, marked by the Cormorant Seal. We came here under one banner, united in a host of thousands, to claim the Moon. But the battle goes against us. I have taken a prisoner and this is the record of its interrogation. If I transgress in your eyes I ask for your forgiveness.

/Eriana. It responds to pain.\n\nIt responds to the Light. Hurt it again. Monster, heed me. Who is your master with the sword?
[static event]\n\nI can hear it. In my head. The swordbearer's name is CROTA. Record that.
/Should I burn it again?\n\nNo. I think you're only feeding it. I will touch its mind. Ghost help.\n\nThey call you Wizard. You must be ancient. I think you value power very much. Will you still be powerful without this piece of your mind?\n\nTell me how to kill Crota.
[static event]\n\nIt showed me the battle. It showed me Wei Ning dead on Crota's blade. It showed me how Crota killed a Guardian with a screaming knife hammered out of his own Ghost.\n\nSo I will take a piece of its mind, and ask again.\n\nTell me how to kill Crota.
[static event]\n\nIncredible. Where? Where is his throne? Where is the twilight world under the dead star eye?
/Eriana there's word from the company in Mare Imbrium. Crota is upon them. Half a hundred dead.\n\nThey need us.\n\nTell me where! Tell me how! TELL ME!
[static event]
/Eriana what did it say It showed me how it did this, just exactly this, to an Awoken man, the knives arranged by its will, like little silver ships, like Ghosts It laughed at me. It said we were the same.
/Crota marches with a thousand Knights and they say the sky above Mare Imbrium has turned into green fire. They are dying in numbers I cannot bear to repeat. He kills them one by one with a sword that eats their Light. Eriana, we have to do something Kill the Wizard. Scatter the ash. It has nothing but lies to offer.\n\nGet your Sparrows. We have Light and fury. That will be enough.\n\nGhostCards:\n\nGhosts\n\nDead Ghosts\n\nGhost Fragment: Ghosts
Ghost Fragment: Ghosts '','' Beyond.\n\nIt is a place, a place casting shadows and emotion.\n\nIt's a real place, I know.\n\nOne hot blue sun, say. And other suns too. Five? I like seven better. What I'm recalling is a giant star with a family of six smaller suns, and you could spend days and nights counting all of the planets circling those suns...except there are no planets. Not anymore. The powers in charge have carved up all of the worlds, and maybe a brown dwarf or two for good measure. With that rubble, they fashioned a topologically creative enclosure, a twisting of space and time sealed behind doors that admit only those who know the magic words. The bones of a hundred planets have been cut smooth and laid out like a floor, a polished and lovely floor creating vast living spaces. A floor bigger than ten thousand worlds, catching the fierce glory of the seven suns. For light, for food. For beauty. And nothing escapes. Not heat, not gravity. Not even the faintest proud sound.\n\nIt could be anywhere. It can live in the cold between galaxies, or folded up inside matter, near enough to touch right now...\n\nI remember it and maybe it's exactly as I describe it. Seven suns wrapped inside magic. Or it's something else entirely, perhaps. A place still fat with life. An abundance of sentient souls, some decent, maybe a few of lesser quality, and everybody stands about or floats about, or they bounce between dimensions. The point is that the residents of this hidden realm live inside a bottle so perfectly hidden that they can't see beyond their own borders. Which shapes a mind in very specific ways.\n\nBut, Beyond is their name for a mysterious, doubtful realm that they can't see.\n\nWhich is us, of course.
Dead Ghosts '','' Battered and drained of their Light, these Ghosts are nevertheless valuable for the information they preserve. Their recovered memories may well prove vital to the City's survival.\n\nThe problem of dead Ghosts troubles the City's scholars. Are new Ghosts still being born? Or is the number of Ghosts dwindling? Will there come a day when no more remain an end to the rise of new\n\nGuardians?\n\nIf that day is coming, then the City faces a desperate race against time to heal the Traveler before attrition takes its toll.
