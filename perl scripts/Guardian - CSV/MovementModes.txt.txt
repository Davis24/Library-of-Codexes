Glide '','' Break the bonds of gravity and convert your jump into a long, smooth glide. Cross dangerous terrain and float from perch to perch to keep the high ground.
Double Jump '','' Bend momentum to jump again in midair.\n\nLeap to even greater heights, or make a quick adjustment while airborne to disorient your foes.
Blink '','' Rip a hole in space and leap from point to point. Master the Blink, and you will be a fearsome killer a spectral force, hard to evade and impossible to pin down.
 '','' Curiosity gets a Warlock into trouble, and force of will gets a Warlock out. Even novices can shear reality with a single deadly gesture.\n\nMovementModesCards:\n\nDouble Jump\n\nGlide\n\nBlink\n\nLift
