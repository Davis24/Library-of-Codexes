Arc Blade '','' Set aside your weapons and lose yourself in the blade trance. Arc Light galvanizes your armor and hastens your movements, and when your knife finds a target it discharges a snap of annihilating current. For as long as the trance lasts, you are the very shadow of death.
Nova Bomb '','' Channel the Traveler's Light into a bolt of energy with the power of a collapsing star. The devastating\n\nNova Bomb scours the battlefield with ethereal fire but be careful in its use. It takes precious moments to summon, and it must be aimed precisely to avoid obstacles.
Ward of Dawn '','' Open a pocket in the universe, an impregnable fortress for you and your allies. The mighty Ward allows Guardians to hold key points and gather their strength in the face of overwhelming opposition.
Fist of Havoc '','' Leap forward and smash the ground, obliterating everything nearby. You will be a thunderbolt but use your fury carefully. If there are survivors, you will surely draw their wrath.
Radiance '','' Open yourself to the Light. Glimpse, for a few rapturous moments, the truth beyond the powers you wield.\n\nA Warlock in a state of Radiance threatens to slip beyond the bonds of the material, shrugging off physical harm, channeling a torrent of abilities. Some may learn to elevate nearby Guardians, gifting them with power. Others, entranced by the Ghosts' power to reach beyond death, may learn to pluck themselves out of nothingness like the phoenix of ancient myth.
Golden Gun '','' Draw a hand cannon burning with Solar Light and loaded with three rounds of sunfire. Aim steady and keep your wits about you. You are a Gunslinger, and this is what you live for.
 '','' "There are flames that even the Darkness cannot extinguish."\n\nThese are dark times. Humanity stands on the brink of extinction. We will carry fire into that darkness a beacon to guide the way, and a pyre to consume our great enemy.\n\nThe Light saved us from death and forged us into weapons. We seek to understand it, to embrace it, to consume and be consumed by it. We hope to become radiant.\n\nOur fellow Guardians need our power. Our civilization needs our strength.\n\nSuperAbilitiesCards:\n\nFist of Havoc\n\nWard of Dawn\n\nGolden Gun\n\nArc Blade\n\nNova Bomb\n\nRadiance
