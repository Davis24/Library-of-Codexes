Ghost Fragment: Human 3 '','' From the diaries of Commander Jacob Hardy, pilot, Ares One\n\nThe hike from Ares One.\n\nYou've watched it. Everything was recorded. I think you can get it in full immersion, now, and fly around like a hummingbird. I'll add what I can.\n\nThe route was planned. We all went together the\n\nCEV and Ares One itself had enough automation to go home alone in the event of crew loss. Whatever we'd find at the artifact, it needed the human element.\n\nWe carried rifles. They made us heavier and slower and probably less safe. I think the argument about the rifles can be left for another time. What's important is It turned out well. Look at me. Look at us! You're talking to a ninetyyearold man. A ninetyyearold who's never been sharper. I'm miles ahead of every cognitive benchmark.\n\nWhat's happened to me is good. What's happened to all of us is good. When we crested that rise and made visual contact with the artifact I don't think any one of us dared dream that it would end this well.\n\nWe went to Mars at the cutting edge of human civilization. And it wasn't our weapons that won the day.\n\nIt was our ship. Our training. Our camaraderie. Our belief that if we just reached out to the universe, not to grasp for profit or security but with an open hand, we would be elevated.\n\nWe were right. That makes me so happy. To this day.
Ghost Fragment: Human 4 '','' From the diaries of Commander Jacob Hardy, pilot, Ares One\n\nThree human beings stood on a high ridge and saw the shape of the future. Saw rain strike a millenniaold desert. Felt the air sweeten with oxygen and warm water and the beginnings of life.\n\nI am sometimes asked if I felt something die. The end of the era of human selfsufficiency.\n\nI don't know how to answer that question. I do know that I was changed. Nobody could experience that kind of wonder and remain unchanged. The decades since have proven that to me.\n\nI knew I'd never fly another mission like that. I recognized the need for a new love. That's why I threw my fresh cognitive skills into understanding the Traveler. How can one entity so quickly and utterly remake an entire world? Fifty years later, I'm conversant in high mathematics, particularly topological thoughts and the slippery irreality of Light. I'm involved in a project to study the Traveler's terraforming actions right now.\n\nBut I still enjoy the interviews. I like going back to that mission.\n\nIt makes me unspeakably happy to see how well it all turned out. And it makes me happy to remember I was there.

And no matter what the darkness brings, we will be here at the dawn."\n\nHumans are survivors, tough and resilient, descended from those who built a Golden Age only to see it ripped away. Now, after an age of retreat and desperate struggle, they fight to take back their solar system and claim a new future.\n\nThere are those who believe the Traveler chose Earth for a reason. Now it is humanity's obligation to prove itself worthy of the Traveler's faith.

But others returned to Earth, where their descendants now fight for the City.\n\nEarthborn Awoken who venture out to the Reef, hoping to learn its secrets, find no special welcome from the reclusive Queen.
Ghost Fragment: Exo 2 '','' Hi. Thanks for your interest. I'm recording this for posterity.\n\nWarlock thanatonauts die and come back with insight. I'm going to attempt the same process to get at buried memories. Specifically, I'm going to fire a charged particle beam into my head and see what comes out.

Ghost Fragment: Human 2 '','' From the diaries of Commander Jacob Hardy, pilot, Ares One\n\nEverybody asks about the words.\n\nThe truth is I'm not much of a poet. Ares One didn't leave us with bandwidth for anything except blunt competence. We came in perilously hot, trying to select a landing site through the chaos of thickening atmosphere and turbulence that bloomed off the target. A twenty minute roundtrip lightspeed delay to\n\nEarth meant we could only count on ourselves.\n\nWhen the number three engine went diagnostic during the second course correction, I thought we might go catastrophic.\n\nBut Qiao brought us in. Mihaylova brought us in. I just flew the ship.\n\nThe Ares One excursion vehicle was built for thin winds and icy dust. We came down into a storm: the breath of God, a ripple of change rolling down off the artifact. We aborted on three sites and finally I took us into powered hover and brought us down on reflexes and instinct.\n\nThen we ran the checklists, suited up, and left the vehicle.\n\nThere was a script, and it's true, I botched it. I got my boots down and I made the most famous gaffe in human history. Said the first thing that came to mind: a warning to the others.
"We're walking into a rising wind."\n\nI didn't mean to say anything immortal. I just thought it'd be useful to know.

Ghost Fragment: Exo '','' which in the end is just a matter of substrate chauvinism. It doesn't matter if the system thinks with flesh or superconductor or topological braids in doped metallic hydrogen, as long as the logic is the same. And our logic is the same. Yours and mine.\n\nIf I am a machine then so are you. If you are not a machine then neither am I. Exo minds are human.\n\nIt is incontrovertible.\n\nYou understand? I'm going to take that slackjawed stare as understanding.\n\nNow here's the real question. Why are Exo minds human? What's the design imperative? Why does a war machine yes, absolutely, I am a war machine, built by human handsÍ¾ and you are a survival machine built by the engine of evolution. Don't interrupt me.\n\nWhy does a war machine have emotions? Why should a war machine have awareness? These are not useful traits on the battlefield. Don't flatter yourself. They are not useful. So why should the Exo mind mimic the human architecture so closely?\n\nYou know what I smell on you? I smell the stink of anthropocentrism. I think you think that there's only one way to think. That's why the Exo mind is so human, you presume. Because all higher thought converges.\n\nMy friend, you should meet the Vex. There is nothing human in them.\n\nNow. This is what I believe happened, back in the time before any Exo can remember. It explains everything.\n\nI think someone wanted to live forever.

They remain ciphers, even to themselves: their origins and purpose lost to time.\n\nWhoever built the Exos fashioned them in humanity's image, gifting them with diversity of mind and body. Many of the City's Exo citizens live and work alongside their organic brethren. But others fight again, reforged in the Light of the Traveler to serve as Guardians.
Ghost Fragment: Human '','' From the diaries of Commander Jacob Hardy, pilot, Ares One\n\nThe mission is a go. Crew of three: Mihaylova, Qiao, myself. Immediate departure at the next\n\nHohmann window to Mars. The MREs and return ships will chase us out.\n\nHow do I feel? I said at the press conference I felt privileged. Historians will read this diary, but it won't take their insight to tell the world that I'm terrified. It's the human reaction.\n\nWhat I wish I could convey is the the exhilaration. That's the biggest thing. I'm not a spiritual man, but I've always believed there's something transcendent about spaceflight. Something pure. We go out there because we can. Because it's who we are.\n\nNow we go because we have to. Because the unknown came to us. In fourteen months we'll be face to face with it, and by the time we arrive, it should be active again just like it was active on Jupiter, and Mercury, and Venus.\n\nI wonder what happens if it doesn't stop at Mars. I wonder if it'll leave us there in the sand, and come to Earth, and do here what it's done everywhere else.\n\nI hate that we're carrying weapons. I understand the necessity. But I hold to my belief: there's something beautiful out there.\n\nIt's up to us to reach it.
Ghost Fragment: Awoken 2 '','' Ghost Fragment: Awoken 2 '','' I was nothingness. If I existed before, I existed as possibility, as potential, stretched thin across the aether. And maybe there was a body that looked like my body, complete with a soul that could be confused for someone rather like me. What I am now was not yet real. And then I was born, and the universe was free to begin.\n\nOthers were present at my birth.\n\nA great ceremony had just begun. Because newborns are selfish beasts, I assumed I was the object of attention.\n\nI didn't notice the singing until the singers fell silent. And then She appeared.\n\nShe was above me. Ethereal and handsome and elegant. I assumed my face was like her face and that odd idea gave me strength enough to smile.
"Secrets," she said. "Creation is built on secrets and the encryptions that keep those secrets safe."\n\nI made my first sound. It meant nothing but she understood it as a question.
"We are a beautiful creation," she said. "And we must keep ourselves very safe."
