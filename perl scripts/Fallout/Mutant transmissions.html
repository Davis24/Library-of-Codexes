Message received: We&#39;re reading you loud an clear, go ahead. Over.

Message sent: We&#39;ve collected four males, two females, and their supplies from the caravan. They&#39;re not too badly contaminated. Tell the Lieutenant that we&#39;re sending them ahead, they might be able to survive the process. We&#39;re going to wait here for a few more days to try and intercept another caravan. Over.

Message received: Roger that. Were any casualties accrued during the acquisition? Over.

Message sent: Negative. Another clean sweep. Base, also tell Scavenger Team one that we&#39;ve run across the same problem they had. One of our scouts did not return from his perimeter patrol. A few of our other scouts reported that there was something big and fast seen near our camp last night. I&#39;ll be checking it out personally at 0600 hours tomorrow morning. Over.

Message received: Copy. We&#39;ll be awaiting your report. If possible, try to capture it. The Master would be very pleased. Over. </p>
