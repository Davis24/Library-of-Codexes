<p> Message sent: Regulator patrol to Regulator base come in. Do you copy? Over.

Message received: This is Regulator base, Principle Regulator Caleb responding. Report? Over.

Message sent: Sir, yes sir! Regulator Second Class Cravotta reporting. We&#39;ve apprehended the Zimmerman boy trying to infiltrate our perimeter again, sir. Orders? Over.

Message received: Shit! Again! Well that&#39;s the last time that&#39;s going to happen. Eliminate him and make it look like the Blades did it. Understand? Over.

Message sent: Sir? Uh... did I copy correctly, sir? Kill him? Over.

Message received: That&#39;s affirmative, Regulator. And I want it messy. Impale him on the guard posts out front- oh, and cut out his tongue so he can&#39;t talk while we &quot;attempt&quot; to save his sorry ass. Over?

Message sent: It shall be done, sir, Over.

End transmission. </p>
