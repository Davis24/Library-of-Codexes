Her name was Quintilla, the most beauteous princess in Tamriel, skilled at all the maidenly skills and an accomplished sorceress.""},{""text"":""Eleven years a widower with a young son named Antiochus, Pelagius arrived at court to find that the city-state was being terrorized by a great demon werewolf. Instead of wooing, Pelagius and Quintilla together went out to save the kingdom. With his sword and her sorcery, the beast was slain and by the powers of mysticism, Quintilla chained the beast's soul to a gem. Pelagius had the gem made into a ring and married her.""},{""text"":""But it was said that the soul of the wolf stayed with the couple until the birth of their first child.""},{""text"":""3E 80\n\""The ambassador from Solitude has arrived, your majesty,\"" whispered the steward Balvus.""},{""text"":""\""Right in the middle of dinner?\"" muttered the Emperor weakly. \""Tell him to wait.\""""},{""text"":""\""No, father, it's important that you see him,\"" said Pelagius, rising. \""You can't make him wait and then give him bad news. It's undiplomatic.\""""},{""text"":""\""Don't go then, you're much better at diplomacy than I am. We should have all the family here,\"" Emperor Uriel II added, suddenly aware how few people were present at his dinner table. \""Where's your mother?\""""},{""text"":""\""Sleeping with the archpriest of Kynareth,\"" Pelagius would have said, but he was, as his father said, diplomatic. Instead he said, \""At prayer.\""""},{""text"":""\""And your brother and sister?\""""},{""text"":""\""Amiel is in Firsthold, meeting with the Archmagister of the Mages Guild. And Galana, though we won't be telling this to the ambassador, of course, is preparing for her wedding to the Duke of Narsis. Since the ambassador expects her to be marrying his patron the King of Solitude instead, we'll tell him that she's at the spa, having a cluster of pestilent boils removed. Tell him that, and he won't press too hard for the marriage, politically expedient though it may be,\"" Pelagius smiled. \""You know how queasy Nords are about warty women.\""""},{""text"":""\""But dash it, I feel like I should have some family around, so I don't look like some old fool despised by his nearest and dearest,\"" growled the Emperor, correctly suspecting this to be the case. \""What about your wife? Where's she and the grandchildren?\""""},{""text"":""\""Quintilla's in the nursery with Cephorus and Magnus. Antiochus is probably whoring around the City. I don't know where Potema is, probably at her studies. I thought you didn't like children around.\""""},{""text"":""\""I do during meetings with ambassadors in damp staterooms,\"" sighed the Emperor. \""They lend an air of, I don't know, innocence and civility. Ah, show the blasted ambassador in,\"" he said to Balvus.""},{""text"":""Potema was bored. It was the rainy season in the Imperial Province, wintertide, and the streets and the gardens of the City were all flooded. She could not remember a time when it was not raining. Had it been only days, or had it been weeks or months since the sun shone? There was no judging of time any more in the constant flickering torch-light of the palace, and as Potema walked through marble and stone hallways, listening to the pelting of the rain, she could think nothing but that she was bored.""},{""text"":""Asthephe, her tutor, would be looking for her now. Ordinarily, she did not mind studying. Rote memorization came easily to her. She quizzed herself as she walked down through the empty ballroom. When did Orsinium fall? 1E 980. Who wrote Tamrilean Tractates? Khosey. When was Tiber Septim born? 2E 288. Who is the current King of Daggerfall? Mortyn, son of Gothlyr. Who is the current Silvenar? Varbarenth, son of Varbaril. Who is the Warlord of Lilmoth? Trick question: it's a lady, Ioa.""},{""text"":""What will I get if I'm a good girl, and don't get into any trouble, and my tutor says I'm an excellent student? Mother and father will renege on their promise to buy me a daedric katana of my own, saying they never remembered that promise, and it's far too expensive and dangerous for a girl my age.""},{""text"":""There were voices coming from the Emperor's stateroom. Her father, her grandfather, and a man with a strange accent, a Nord. Potema moved a stone she had loosened behind a tapestry and listened in.""},{""text"":""\""Let us be frank, your imperial majesty,\"" came the Nord's voice. \""My sire, the King of Solitude, doesn't care if Princess Galana looked like an orc. He wants an alliance with the Imperial family, and you agreed to give him Galana or give back the millions of gold he gave to you to quell the Khajiiti rebellion in Torval. This was the agreement you swore to honor.\""""},{""text"":""\""I remember no such agreement,\"" came her father's voice, \""Can you, my liege?\""""},{""text"":""There was a mumbling noise that Potema took to be her grandfather, the ancient Emperor.""},{""text"":""\""Perhaps we should take a walk to the Hall of Records, my mind may be going,\"" the Nord's voice sounded sarcastic. \""I distinctly remember your seal being placed on the agreement before it was locked away. Of course, I may verily be mistaken.\""""},{""text"":""\""We will send a page to the Hall to get the document you refer to,\"" replied her father's voice, with the cruel, soothing quality he used whenever he was about to break a promise. Potema knew it well. She replaced the loose stone and hurried out of the ballroom. She knew well how slowly the pages walked, used to running errands for a doddering emperor. She could make it to the Hall of Records in no time at all.""},{""text"":""The massive ebony door was locked, of course, but she knew what to do. A year ago, she caught her mother's Bosmer maid pilfering some jewelry, and in exchange for her silence, forced the young woman to teach her how to pick locks. Potema pulled two pins off her red diamond broach and slid the first into the first lock, holding her hand steady, and memorizing the pattern of tumblers and grooves within the mechanism.""},{""text"":""Each lock had a geography of its own.""},{""text"":""The lock to the kitchen larder: six free tumblers, a frozen seventh, and a counter bolt. She had broken into that just for fun, but if she had been a poisoner, the whole Imperial household would be dead by now, she thought, smiling.""},{""text"":""The lock to her brother Antiochus' secret stash of Khajiiti pornography: just two free tumblers and a pathetic poisoned quill trap easily dismantled with pressure on the counterweight. That had been a profitable score. It was strange that Antiochus, who seemed to have no shame, proved so easy to blackmail. She was, after all, only twelve, and the differences between the perversions of the cat people and the perversions of the Cyrodiils seemed pretty academic. Still, Antiochus had to give her the diamond broach, which she treasured.""},{""text"":""She had never been caught. Not when she broke into the archmage's study and stole his oldest spellbook. Not when she broke into the guest room of the King of Gilane, and stole his crown the morning before Magnus's official Welcoming ceremony. It had become too easy to torment her family with these little crimes. But here was a document the Emperor wanted, for a very important meeting. She would get it first.""},{""text"":""But this, this was the hardest lock she ever opened. Over and over, she massaged the tumblers, gently pushing aside the forked clamp that snatched at her pins, drumming the counterweights. It nearly took her a half a minute to break through the door to the Hall of Records, where the Elder Scrolls were housed.""},{""text"":""The documents were well organized by year, province, and kingdom, and it took Potema only a short while to find the Promise of Marriage between Uriel Septim II, by the Grace of the Gods, Emperor of the Holy Cyrodiilic Empire of Tamriel and his daughter the Princess Galana, and His Majesty King Mantiarco of Solitude. She grabbed her prize and was out of the Hall with the door well-locked before the page was even in sight.""},{""text"":""Back in the ball room, she loosened the stone and listened eagerly to the conversation within. For a few minutes, the three men, the Nord, the Emperor, and her father just spoke of the weather and some boring diplomatic details. Then there was the sound of footsteps and a young voice, the page.""},{""text"":""\""Your Imperial Majesty, I have searched the Hall of Records and cannot find the document you asked for.\""""},{""text"":""\""There, you see,\"" came Potema's father's voice. \""I told you it didn't exist.\""""},{""text"":""\""But I saw it!\"" The Nord's voice was furious. \""I was there when my liege and the emperor signed it! I was there!\""""},{""text"":""\""I hope you aren't doubting the word of my father, the sovereign Emperor of all Tamriel, not when there's now proof that you must have been ... mistaken,\"" Pelagius's voice was low, dangerous.""},{""text"":""\""Of course not,\"" said the Nord, conceding quickly. \""But what will I tell my king? He is to have no connection with the Imperial family, and no gold returned to him, as the agreement -- as he and I believed the agreement to be?\""""},{""text"":""\""We don't want any bad feelings between the kingdom of Solitude and us,\"" came the Emperor's voice, rather feeble, but clear enough. \""What if we offered King Mantiarco our granddaughter instead?\""""},{""text"":""Potema felt the chill of the room descend on her.""},{""text"":""\""The Princess Potema? Is she not too young?\"" asked the Nord.""},{""text"":""\""She is thirteen years old,\"" said her father. \""That's old enough to wed.\""""},{""text"":""\""She would an ideal mate for your king,\"" said the Emperor. \""She is, admittedly, from what I see of her, very shy and innocent, but I'm certain she would quickly grasp the ways of court -- she is, after all, a Septim. I think she would be an excellent Queen of Solitude. Not too exciting, but noble.\""""},{""text"":""\""The granddaughter of the Emperor is not as close as his daughter,\"" said the Nord, rather miserably. \""But I don't see how we can refuse the offer. I will send word to my king.\""""},{""text"":""\""You have our leave,\"" said the Emperor, and Potema heard the sound of the Nord leaving the stateroom.""},{""text"":""Tears streamed down Potema's eyes. She knew who the King of Solitude was from her studies. Mantiarco. Sixty-two years old, and quite fat. And she knew how far Solitude was, and how cold, in the northernmost clime. Her father and grandfather were abandoning her to the barbaric Nords. The voices in the room continued talking.""},{""text"":""\""Well-acted, my boy. Now, make sure you burn that document,\"" said her father.""},{""text"":""\""My Prince?\"" asked the page's querulous voice.""},{""text"":""\""The agreement between the Emperor and the King of Solitude, you fool. We don't want its existence known.\""""},{""text"":""\""My Prince, I told the truth. I couldn't find the document in the Hall of Records. It seems to be missing.\""""},{""text"":""\""By Lorkhan!\"" roared her father. \""Why is everything in this palace always misplaced? Go back to the Hall and keep searching until you find it!\""""},{""text"":""Potema looked at the document. Millions of gold pieces promised to the kingdom of Solitude in the event of Princess Galana not marrying the king. She could bring it into her father, and perhaps as a reward he would not marry her to Mantiarco. Or perhaps not. She could blackmail her father and the Emperor with it, and make a tidy sum of money. Or she could produce it when she became Queen of Solitude to fill her coffers, and buy anything she wanted. More than a daedric katana, that was for certain.""},{""text"":""So many possibilities, Potema thought. And she found herself not bored anymore.""},{""text"":""The Wolf Queen, v2""},{""text"":""The Wolf Queen""},{""text"":""Book Two""},{""text"":""\nby \nWaughin Jarth\n ""},{""text"":""\nFrom the pen of the first century third era sage Montocai:""},{""text"":""3E 82:\nA year after the wedding of his 14-year-old granddaughter the Princess Potema to King Mantiarco of the Nordic kingdom of Solitude, the Emperor Uriel Septim II passed on. His son Pelagius Septim II was made emperor, and he faced a greatly depleted treasury, thanks to his father's poor management.""},{""text"":""As the new Queen of Solitude, Potema faced opposition from the old Nordic houses, who viewed her as an outsider. Mantiarco had been widowed, and his former queen was loved. She had left him a son, Prince Bathorgh, who was two years older than his stepmother, and loved her not. But the king loved his queen, and suffered with her through miscarriage after miscarriage, until her 29th year, when she bore him a son.""},{""text"":""3E 97:\n\""You must do something to help the pain!\"" Potema cried, baring her teeth. The healer Kelmeth immediately thought of a she-wolf in labor, but he put the image from his mind. Her enemies called her the Wolf Queen for certes, but not because of any physical resemblance.""},{""text"":""\""Your Majesty, there is no injury for me to heal. The pain you feel is natural and helpful for the birth,\"" he was going to add more words of consolation, but he had to break off to duck the mirror she flung at him.""},{""text"":""\""I'm not a pignosed peasant girl!\"" She snarled, \""I am the Queen of Solitude, daughter of the Emperor! Summon the daedra! I'll trade the soul of every last subject of mine for a little comfort!\""""},{""text"":""\""My Lady,\"" said the healer nervously, drawing the curtains and blotting out the cold morning sun. \""It is not wise to make such offers even in jest. The eyes of Oblivion are forever watching for just such a rash interjection.\""""},{""text"":""\""What would you know of Oblivion, healer?\"" she growled, but her voice was calmer, quieter. The pain had relaxed. \""Would you fetch me that mirror I hurled at you?\""""},{""text"":""\""Are you going to throw it again, your Majesty?\"" said the healer with a taut smile, obeying her.""},{""text"":""\""Very likely,\"" she said, looking at her reflection. \""And next time I won't miss.

And leave us. I'll howl for you when the pain returns.\""""},{""text"":""\""Yes, your Majesty.\""""},{""text"":""A few minutes later, Lord Vhokken was shown into the chamber. He was an enormous bald man whose friends and enemies called Mount Vhokken, and when he spoke it was with the low grumble of thunder. The Queen was one of the very few people Vhokken knew who was not the least bit intimidated by him, and he offered her a smile.""},{""text"":""\""My queen, how are you feeling?\"" he asked.""},{""text"":""\""Damned. But you're looking like Springtide has come to Mount Vhokken.

The fellow invents new strategies of self-defense every year to show off during the games.

He moves like lightning. You wouldn't think it of him, but he always seems to use his awkwardness to his advantage, to throw his opponents off.

Make certain that the construction begins at once, today! Your future, my future, and the future of this child depend on it!

She wrapped her arms around his neck, as he heaved his sobs down on her and their child.""},{""text"":""\""Henceforth,\"" he said quietly. \""Bathorgh is no longer my heir.

She also purchased a cheap ring of fire resistance.""},{""text1"":""\""For your kindness to an old woman, I've bought you these,\"" she said, giving the boy the necklace and the ring. \""You can give the ring to your uncle, and tell him it has been enchanted with a levitation spell, so if ever he needs to leap from high places, it will protect him.

But Kagrenac took great offense, and asked whom Nerevar thought he was, that he might presume to judge the affairs of the Dwemer.""},{""text1"":""Nerevar was further troubled, and made pilgrimage to Holamayan, the sacred temple of Azura, and Azura confirmed that all that Dagoth Ur said was indeed true and that the creation of a New God of the Dwemer should be prevented at all costs. When Nerevar came back and told us what the goddess had said, we felt our judgements confirmed, and again counseled him to war, chiding Nerevar for his naive trust in friendship, and reminding Nerevar of his duty to protect the faith and security of the Chimer against the impiety and dangerous ambitious of the Dwemer.""},{""text1"":""Then Nerevar went back to Vvardenfell one last time, hoping that negotiations and compromise might once again preserve the peace. But this time the friends Nerevar and Dumac quarreled bitterly, and as a result, the Chimer and Dwemer went to war.""},{""text1"":""The Dwemer were well-defended by their fortress at Red Mountain, but Nerevar's cunning drew most of Dumac's armies out into the field and pinned them there, while Nerevar, Dagoth Ur, and a small group of companions could make their way into the Heart Chamber by secret means. There, Nerevar the Chimer King met Dumac the Dwarf King and they both collapsed from grievous wounds and draining magics. With Dumac fallen, and threatened by Dagoth Ur and others, Kagrenac turned his tools upon the Heart, and Nerevar said he saw Kagrenac and all his Dwemer companions at once disappear from the world. In that instant, Dwemer everywhere disappeared without a trace. But Kagrenac's tools remained, and Dagoth Ur seized them, and he carried them to Nerever, saying, \""That fool Kagrenac has destroyed his own people with these things. We should destroy them, right away, lest they fall into the wrong hands.\""""},{""text1"":""But Nerevar was resolved to confer with his queen and his generals, who had foreseen that this war would come and whose counsel he would not ignore again. \""I will ask the Tribunal what we shall do with them, for they have had wisdom in the past that I had not. Stay here, loyal Dagoth Ur, until I return.\"" So Nerevar told Dagoth Ur to protect the tools and the Heart Chamber until he returned.""},{""text1"":""Then Nerevar was carried to us where we waited on the slopes of Red Mountain, and he told us all that had transpired under Red Mountain. What Nerevar had said was that the Dwemer had used special tools to turn their people into immortals and that the Heart of Lorkhan held wondrous powers. [Only later did we hear from others present that Dagoth Ur had thought the Dwemer destroyed, not made immortal. And no one knows for sure what really happened there.]""},{""text1"":""After hearing Nerevar, we gave our counsel as he requested, proposing, \""We should preserve these tools in trust for the welfare of the Chimer people. And who knows, perhaps the Dwemer are not gone forever, but merely transported to some distant realm, from which they may some day return to threaten our security once again. Therefore, we need to keep these tools, to study them and their principles, so that we may be safe in future generations.\""""},{""text1"":""And though Nerevar voiced his grave misgivings, he was willing to be ruled by our counsel, under one condition: that we all together should swear a solemn oath upon Azura that the tools would never be used in the profane manner that the Dwemer had intended. We all readily agreed, and swore solemn oaths at Nerevar's dictation.""},{""text1"":""So then we went with Nerevar back into Red Mountain and met with Dagoth Ur. Dagoth Ur refused to deliver the tools to us, saying they were dangerous, and we could not touch them. Dagoth Ur seemed to be irrational, insisting that only he could be trusted with the tools, and then we guessed that he had somehow been affected by his handling of the tools, but now I feel sure that he had privately learned the powers of the tools, and had in some confused way decided he must have them for himself. Then Nerevar and our guard resorted to force to secure the tools. Somehow Dagoth Ur and his retainers escaped, but we gained the tools, and delivered them to Sotha Sil for study and safe-keeping.""},{""text1"":""For some years we kept the oaths we swore to Azura with Nerevar, but during that time, in secret, Sotha Sil must have studied the tools and divined their mysteries. And at last he came to us with a vision of a new world of peace, with justice and honor for nobles, and health and prosperity for the commoners, with the Tribunal as immortal patrons and guides. And dedicating ourselves to this vision of a better world, we made a pilgrimage to Red Mountain and transformed ourselves with the power of Kagrenac's tools.""},{""text1"":""And no sooner than we had completed our rituals and begun to discover our new-found powers, the Daedra Lord Azura appeared and cursed us for our foresworn oaths. By her powers of prophecy, she assured us that her champion, Nerevar, true to his oath, would return to punish us for our perfidy, and to make sure such profane knowledge might never again be used to mock and defy the will of the gods. But Sotha Sil said to her, \""The old gods are cruel and arbitrary, and distant from the hopes and fears of mer. Your age is past. We are the new gods, born of the flesh, and wise and caring of the needs of our people. Spare us your threats and chiding, inconstant spirit. We are bold and fresh, and will not fear you.\""""},{""text1"":""And then, in that moment, all Chimer were changed into Dunmer, and our skins turned ashen and our eyes into fire. Of course, we only knew at that time that this had happened to us, but Azura said, \""This is not my act, but your act. You have chosen your fate, and the fate of your people, and all the Dunmer shall share your fate, from now to the end of time. You think yourselves gods, but you are blind, and all is darkness.\"" And Azura left us alone, in darkness, and we were all afraid, but we put on brave faces, and went forth from Red Mountain to build the new world of our dreams.""},{""text1"":""And the new world we shaped was glorious and generous, and the worship of the Dunmer fervent and grateful. The Dunmer were at first afraid of their new faces, but Sotha Sil spoke to them, saying that it was not a curse but a blessing, a sign of their changed natures, and sign of the special favor they might enjoy as New Mer, no longer barbarians trembling before ghosts and spirits, but civilized mer, speaking directly to their immortal friends and patrons, the three faces of the Tribunal. And we were all inspired by Sotha Sil's speech and vision, and took heart. And over time, we crafted the customs and institutions of a just and honorable society, and the land of Resdayn knew millennia of peace, equity, and prosperity unknown to other savage races.""},{""text1"":""But beneath Red Mountain, Dagoth Ur had survived. And even as the light of our bold new world shined ever more brightly, beneath Red Mountain, the darkness gathered, a darkness that was close kin to the bright light that Sotha Sil coaxed from the Heart of Lorkhan with the Tools of Kagrenac. As the darkness grew, we fought it, and crafted walls to confine it, but we never could destroy it, for the source of the darkness was the same source as the source of our own divine inspiration.""},{""text1"":""And in these latter days of Morrowind, reduced to a subjugated province of the Western Empire, as the glory of the Temple fades, and the dark tide rises from Red Mountain, we are reminded of Azura and her promised champion's return. We have waited, blind, and in darkness, mere shadows, drained of our ardent vision, in shame of our folly, in fear of our judgement, and in hope of our deliverance. We do not know if the outlander claiming to fulfill the prophecies of the Nerevarine is our old companion Nerevar reborn, or a pawn of the Emperor, or a catspaw of Azura, or some simple twist of fate. But we insist you adhere to Temple doctrine, and conform to the strictures dividing the Hierographa from the Apographa, and that you not speak that which must not be spoken openly. Act as a dutiful priest should, in accordance with your vows of obedience to the canons and archcanons, and all will be forgiven. Defy me, and you will know what it is to stand against a god.""},{""text1"":""-- Vivec""}]"

Because of his  allegiance to the crown, the king had felt the need to grant him a  castle and land, but he didn't necessarily want him as a neighbor so the  land he granted was far from civilization. Right in an area of  Vvardenfell that is, even today, not quite civilized to this day. Arslic  Oan built a walled stronghold and settled down with his unhappy slaves  to enjoy a quiet if somewhat grim life.""},{""text"":""It was not long before his stronghold's integrity was tested.

These cannibalistic Nords began attacking  Arslic Oan's slaves in the fields, and then slowly grew bolder, until  they held the very stronghold itself under siege. They were quite a  fearsome sight you can imagine: a horde of wild-eyed men and women with  dagger-like teeth filed to tear flesh, wielding massive clubs, cloaked  only in the skins of their victims.""},{""text"":""Arslic Oan assumed that if he ignored them, they'd go away.""},{""text"":""Unfortunately, the first thing that the Nords did was to poison the  stream that carried water into the walled stronghold. All the livestock  and most of the slaves died very quickly before this was discovered.  There was no hope of rescue, at least for several months when the king's  emissaries would come reluctantly to visit the disagreeable vassal. The  next closest source of water was on the other side of the hill, so  Arslic Oan sent three of his slaves with empty jugs to bring some back.""},{""text"":""They were beaten with clubs and eaten before they were a few feet  outside the stronghold gates.

Arslic Oan went to talk to his armorer,  one of his few slaves with specific talents and duties.""},{""text"":""\""The slaves need armor if they're going to make it to the river and  back,\"" he said. \""Collect every scrap of steel and iron you can find,  every hinge, knife, ring, cup, everything that isn't needed to keep the  walls sturdy, smelt it, and give me the most and the best armor you can,  very, very quickly.\""""},{""text"":""The armorer, whose name was Gorkith, was used to Arslic Oan's demands,  and knew that there could be no compromise on the quality and quantity  of the armor, or the speed at which he worked. He labored for thirty  hours without a break - and, recall, without any water to slake his  thirst as he struggled with the kiln and anvil - until finally, he had  six suits of mixed-metal armor.""},{""text"":""Six slaves were chosen, clad in the armor, and sent with jars to collect  river water. At first, the mission progressed well. The Nord attacked  the armored slaves with their clubs, but they continued their march  forward, warding off the blows.

Eventually, one  by one, they fell, the armor was peeled from their bodies, and they were  eaten.""},{""text"":""\""The slaves couldn't move quickly enough in that heavy armor you made,\""  said Arslic Oan to Gorkith. \""I need you to collect all the cadavers of  the poisoned livestock, strip their skin, and give me the most and the  best leather armor you can, very, very quickly.\""""},{""text"":""Gorklith did as he was told, though it was a particularly repulsive task  given the rancid state of the livestock.

He had thought about doing something with stone or wood, but  there were practical problems with demolishing more of the stronghold.  The next most prevalent stuff present in the stronghold was skinned dead  bodies, hunks of muscle, fat, blood, and bone. For six hours, he toiled  relentlessly until he produced eighteen suits of bonemold, the first  ones ever created. Arslic Oan was somewhat dubious at the sight (and  smell) but he was very thirsty, and willing to sacrifice another  eighteen slaves if necessary.""},{""text"":""\""Might I suggest,\"" Gorklith queried tremulously, \""Having the slaves  practice moving about in the armor, here in the courtyard, before  sending them to face the Nords?\""""},{""text"":""Arslic Oan coolly allowed it, and for a few hours, the slaves wandered  about the stronghold courtyard in their suits of bonemold.

By the time they were sent out of the castle gates, they  were easily very nearly almost amateurs in the use of their medium  weight armor.""},{""text"":""Seventeen of them were killed and eaten, but one made it back with a jar  of water.""},{""text"":""\""It's perfect nonsense,\"" said Xiomara. \""But my point is still valid even  so.

Such is the way of the tale teller.\""""},{""text"":""In eighteen hours, Gorkith had fifty-three suits of bonemail (said  Hallgerd, continuing, not really minding the interruption) prepared for  the slaves. Without prompting, he ordered the slaves to practice using  the armor, and even allowed them more training time than their  predecessors. They not only learned how to move and stop quickly in  bonemold, but how to adjust their peripheral vision to see a blow before  it came, and to sway to dodge, and where the sturdiest reinforcement  points on the arm were -- the center of the chest and the abdomen -- and  how to position themselves to take blows there, against their natural  instincts. The slaves even had time for a mock battle before being sent  out among the cannibals.""},{""text"":""The slaves handled themselves admirably. Very few, just fifteen slaves,  were killed and eaten out right. Only ten were killed and eaten when  they reached the river. That was when things did not go according to  Arslic Oan's plans. Twenty-one slaves with jars of water took off for  the hills. Only eight returned to the castle, largely because they were  blocked by the cannibal Nords. It was a larger percentage than he had  anticipated surviving, but Arslic Oan felt righteous indignation at the  paucity of loyalty.""},{""text"":""\""Are you absolutely certain you wouldn't rather flee?\"" he hollered from  the battlements.""},{""text"":""Finally, he allowed the survivors in. Three had been killed waiting for  the gate to open. Two more died almost upon stepping into the courtyard.  One was delirious, walking around in circles, laughing and dancing  before suddenly collapsing. That meant five jars of water for four  people, the two surviving slaves, Arslic Oan, and Gorkith. As the lord  of the manor, Arslic Oan took the extra jar, but he was democratic with  the others.""},{""text"":""\""You're quite correct,\"" frowned Garaz. \""This story is getting more and  more appalling.\""""},{""text"":""\""Just wait,\"" smiled Hallgerd.""},{""text"":""The next morning (Hallgerd continued) Arslic Oan awoke to a perfectly  still and quiet stronghold.

The  rest of the body oozed out of the crack, a soft bag of muscle and blood.  Behind Arslic Oan and to the side, there was more movement, more slaves  welling up through the cracks in the stone. They were all around him,  reaching out.""},{""text"":""\""Give us,\"" moaned Ponik, his tongue rolling about his hanging jaw. \""Give  us back our bones.\""""},{""text"":""Arslic Oan began to rip off his bonemold, throwing it to the floor.

These cannibalistic Nords began attacking  Arslic Oan's slaves in the fields, and then slowly grew bolder, until  they held the very stronghold itself under siege. They were quite a  fearsome sight you can imagine: a horde of wild-eyed men and women with  dagger-like teeth filed to tear flesh, wielding massive clubs, cloaked  only in the skins of their victims.""},{""text1"":""Arslic Oan assumed that if he ignored them, they'd go away.""},{""text1"":""Unfortunately, the first thing that the Nords did was to poison the  stream that carried water into the walled stronghold. All the livestock  and most of the slaves died very quickly before this was discovered.  There was no hope of rescue, at least for several months when the king's  emissaries would come reluctantly to visit the disagreeable vassal. The  next closest source of water was on the other side of the hill, so  Arslic Oan sent three of his slaves with empty jugs to bring some back.""},{""text1"":""They were beaten with clubs and eaten before they were a few feet  outside the stronghold gates. The next group he sent through he gave  sticks to defend themselves. They made it a few feet farther, but were  also overwhelmed, beaten, and devoured.

Arslic Oan went to talk to his armorer,  one of his few slaves with specific talents and duties.""},{""text1"":""\""The slaves need armor if they're going to make it to the river and  back,\"" he said. \""Collect every scrap of steel and iron you can find,  every hinge, knife, ring, cup, everything that isn't needed to keep the  walls sturdy, smelt it, and give me the most and the best armor you can,  very, very quickly.\""""},{""text1"":""The armorer, whose name was Gorkith, was used to Arslic Oan's demands,  and knew that there could be no compromise on the quality and quantity  of the armor, or the speed at which he worked. He labored for thirty  hours without a break - and, recall, without any water to slake his  thirst as he struggled with the kiln and anvil - until finally, he had  six suits of mixed-metal armor.""},{""text1"":""Six slaves were chosen, clad in the armor, and sent with jars to collect  river water. At first, the mission progressed well. The Nord attacked  the armored slaves with their clubs, but they continued their march  forward, warding off the blows. Gradually, however, the slaves seemed to  be walking uncertainly, dazed by the endless barrage. Eventually, one  by one, they fell, the armor was peeled from their bodies, and they were  eaten.""},{""text1"":""\""The slaves couldn't move quickly enough in that heavy armor you made,\""  said Arslic Oan to Gorkith. \""I need you to collect all the cadavers of  the poisoned livestock, strip their skin, and give me the most and the  best leather armor you can, very, very quickly.\""""},{""text1"":""Gorklith did as he was told, though it was a particularly repulsive task  given the rancid state of the livestock.

They progressed, at first, much better than the  earlier expedition. Two fell almost immediately, but the others had some  luck out-maneuvering their assailants while deflecting an occasional  blow of the club. Several got to the river, three were able to fill up  their jars, and one fellow very nearly made it back to the stronghold  gates. Alas, he fell and was eaten. The Nords possessed a remarkably  healthy appetite.""},{""text1"":""\""What we need before I completely run out of slaves,\"" said Arslic Oan  thoughtfully to Gorkith. \""Is an armor sturdier than leather but lighter  than metal.\""""},{""text1"":""The armorer had already considered that and taken stock of the materials  available. He had thought about doing something with stone or wood, but  there were practical problems with demolishing more of the stronghold.  The next most prevalent stuff present in the stronghold was skinned dead  bodies, hunks of muscle, fat, blood, and bone. For six hours, he toiled  relentlessly until he produced eighteen suits of bonemold, the first  ones ever created. Arslic Oan was somewhat dubious at the sight (and  smell) but he was very thirsty, and willing to sacrifice another  eighteen slaves if necessary.""},{""text1"":""\""Might I suggest,\"" Gorklith queried tremulously, \""Having the slaves  practice moving about in the armor, here in the courtyard, before  sending them to face the Nords?\""""},{""text1"":""Arslic Oan coolly allowed it, and for a few hours, the slaves wandered  about the stronghold courtyard in their suits of bonemold. They grew  used to the give of the joints, the rigidity of the backplate, the  weight pushed onto their shoulders and hips. They discovered how to  plant their feet slightly askew to keep their balance steady; how to  quickly turn, pivoting without falling down; how to break into a run and  stop quickly. By the time they were sent out of the castle gates, they  were easily very nearly almost amateurs in the use of their medium  weight armor.""},{""text1"":""Seventeen of them were killed and eaten, but one made it back with a jar  of water.""},{""text1"":""\""It's perfect nonsense,\"" said Xiomara. \""But my point is still valid even  so.

One of them finally makes it back with some  water.\""""},{""text1"":""It was only one jarful of water (said Hallgerd, pulling back in his  chair and continuing the tale), and Arslic Oan drank most of it, passing  the remains to his dear armorer Gorkith and the last dribbles to the  few dozen slaves who still lived. It was hardly enough to sustain health  and well-being. Another expedition was necessary, but they had only one  suit of bonemold left, as there was only one survivor of the trip.""},{""text1"":""\""One out of eighteen slaves made it through the gauntlet of Nords  wearing that marvelous bonemold armor of yours,\"" said Arslic Oan to  Gorkith. \""And one can only carry back enough water for one. Therefore,  mathematically, as we have, counting you and me, fifty-six remaining  people at the stronghold, we need armor for fifty-four. Since we already  have one, you only need to make fifty-three to make the total. That  way, three will make it back, with enough water for you and me and  whoever's in the best condition to partake. I don't know what we'll do  after that, but if we wait, we won't have enough slaves to fetch even a  couple days' worth of water.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I understand,\"" whimpered Gorkith. \""But how am I going to make the  armor?

In  eighteen hours -""},{""text1"":""\""What do you mean 'Arslic Oan gave an order which Gorkith fearfully  complied with'?\"" asked Xiomara. \""What was the order?\""""},{""text1"":""\""All will be clear,\"" smiled Hallgerd. \""I have to chose what to reveal  and what to conceal. Such is the way of the tale teller.\""""},{""text1"":""In eighteen hours, Gorkith had fifty-three suits of bonemail (said  Hallgerd, continuing, not really minding the interruption) prepared for  the slaves. Without prompting, he ordered the slaves to practice using  the armor, and even allowed them more training time than their  predecessors. They not only learned how to move and stop quickly in  bonemold, but how to adjust their peripheral vision to see a blow before  it came, and to sway to dodge, and where the sturdiest reinforcement  points on the arm were -- the center of the chest and the abdomen -- and  how to position themselves to take blows there, against their natural  instincts. The slaves even had time for a mock battle before being sent  out among the cannibals.""},{""text1"":""The slaves handled themselves admirably. Very few, just fifteen slaves,  were killed and eaten out right. Only ten were killed and eaten when  they reached the river. That was when things did not go according to  Arslic Oan's plans. Twenty-one slaves with jars of water took off for  the hills. Only eight returned to the castle, largely because they were  blocked by the cannibal Nords. It was a larger percentage than he had  anticipated surviving, but Arslic Oan felt righteous indignation at the  paucity of loyalty.""},{""text1"":""\""Are you absolutely certain you wouldn't rather flee?\"" he hollered from  the battlements.""},{""text1"":""Finally, he allowed the survivors in. Three had been killed waiting for  the gate to open. Two more died almost upon stepping into the courtyard.  One was delirious, walking around in circles, laughing and dancing  before suddenly collapsing. That meant five jars of water for four  people, the two surviving slaves, Arslic Oan, and Gorkith. As the lord  of the manor, Arslic Oan took the extra jar, but he was democratic with  the others.""},{""text1"":""\""You're quite correct,\"" frowned Garaz. \""This story is getting more and  more appalling.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Just wait,\"" smiled Hallgerd.""},{""text1"":""The next morning (Hallgerd continued) Arslic Oan awoke to a perfectly  still and quiet stronghold. There was no murmuring in the corridors, no  sound of hard labor in the courtyard. He dressed and surveyed the scene.  It appeared that the fortress was utterly deserted. Arslic Oan walked  down to the armorer's quarters, but the door was locked.""},{""text1"":""\""Open up,\"" said Arslic Oan, patiently. \""We need to speak. Thirty out of  fifty-four slaves successfully made it to the river and gathered water.  Admittedly, some then fled, and a couple didn't survive because I needed  to correct their fickleness, but mathematically, that's a fifty-five  percent survival rate. If you and I and the two remaining slaves made  the next run to the river, we two should survive.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Zilian and Gelo left last night with their armor,\"" cried Gorklith  through the door.""},{""text1"":""\""Who are Zilian and Gelo?\""""},{""text1"":""\""The two remaining slaves! They don't remain anymore!\""""},{""text1"":""\""Well, that's vexing,\"" said Arslic Oan. \""Still we must continue on.  Mathematically--\""""},{""text1"":""\""I heard something last night,\"" whimpered Gorklith in a funny voice.  \""Like footsteps, only different, and they were moving through the walls.

He practiced in the courtyard, impressing himself with his  natural comfortably with medium weight armor. For hours, he boxed,  feinted, dodged, sprinted, skipped, jumped, and generally cavorted  about. When he felt tired, he retired to the shade and took a nap.""},{""text1"":""The sound of the king's trumpet woke him with a start. Night had fallen,  and for a moment, he thought he had been dreaming. Then the alarum  sounded again, far in the distance, but clear. Arslic Oan leapt to his  feet and ran to the ramparts. Several miles away, he could see the  emissaries and their vast and well-armed escort approach. They were  there early! The cannibal Nords below looked at one another with  consternation. Savages they might be, but they knew when a superior  force was approaching.""},{""text1"":""Arslic Oan joyously dashed down the stairs to Gorklith's chamber. The  door was still locked. He beat on it, cajoling, demanding, threatening.  Finally, he found a key, one of the few scraps of metal that had not  been smelted days before.""},{""text1"":""Gorklith appeared to be sleeping, but as Arslic Oan approached, he  noticed that the armorer's mouth and eyes were wide open and his arms  were folded unnaturally behind his back. On closer inspection, the  armorer was obviously dead. What was more, his face and whole body were  sunken, like an empty pig's bladder.""},{""text1"":""Something moved through the walls, like a footfall only... squishy.  Arslic Oan expertly and gracefully turned to face it, completely in  balance.""},{""text1"":""At first, it seemed like nothing more than a bubble expanding through  one of the cracks in the stone. As more of the flesh-colored gelatinous  matter emerged, it more clearly resembled part of a face. A flaccid,  almost shapeless face with a low brow and a slack, toothless jaw. The  rest of the body oozed out of the crack, a soft bag of muscle and blood.  Behind Arslic Oan and to the side, there was more movement, more slaves  welling up through the cracks in the stone. They were all around him,  reaching out.""},{""text1"":""\""Give us,\"" moaned Ponik, his tongue rolling about his hanging jaw. \""Give  us back our bones.\""""},{""text1"":""Arslic Oan began to rip off his bonemold, throwing it to the floor. A  hundred figures, more, pooled into the small chamber.""},{""text1"":""\""That's not enough.\""""},{""text1"":""The cannibals had cleared away by the time the king's emissaries arrived  at Arslic Oan's gates. They had not been looking forward to this visit.  It was best, they though philosophically, to begin with the worst of  the king's noblemen, so to end their trip well. They sounded the alarum  once again, but the gates did not open. There was no sound from Arslic  Oan's stronghold.""},{""text1"":""It took a few hours to gain access. If the emissaries had not brought a  professional acrobat with them for entertainment, it might have taken  longer. The place seemed to be abandoned. They searched every room,  until finally they came to the armorer's.""},{""text1"":""There they found the master of the manor, folded neatly, legs behind his  head, arms behind the legs, like a fine gown. Not a bone in his body.""},{""text1"":""\""The first part of your story was complete nonsense,\"" cried Xiomara.  \""But now it doesn't hold true on any level.

As ignorant speeches are hardly uncommon, there was no reason to respond to it. Unfortunately, he has since had the speech privately printed as \""Bero's Speech to the Battlemages,\"" and it's received some small, undeserved attention in academic circles. Let us put his misconceptions to rest.""},{""text1"":""Bero began his lecture with an occasionally factual account of famous Battlemages from Zurin Arctus, Tiber Septim's Imperial Battlemage, to Jagar Tharn, Uriel Septim VII's Imperial Battlemage. His intent was to show that where it matters, the Battlemage relies on other Schools of Magicka, not the School of Destruction which is supposedly a Battlemage's particular forte. Allow me first to dispute these so-called historical facts.""},{""text1"":""Zurin Arctus did not create the golem Numidium by spells of Mysticism and Conjuration as Bero alleges. The truth is that we don't know how Numidium was created or if it was a golem or atronach in any traditional sense of those words. Uriel V's Battlemage Hethoth was not an Imperial Battlemage -- he was simply a sorcerer in the employ of the Empire, thus which spells he cast in the various battles on Akavir are irrelevant, not to mention heresay. Bero calls Empress Morihatha's Battlemage Welloc \""an accomplished diplomat\"" but not \""a powerful student of the School of Destruction.\"" I congratulate Bero on correctly identifying an Imperial Battlemage, but there are many written examples of Welloc's skill in the School of Destruction. The sage Celarus, for example, wrote extensively about Welloc casting the Vampiric Cloud on the rebellious army of Blackrose, causing their strength and skill to pass on to their opponents. What is this, but an impressive example of the School of Destruction?""},{""text1"":""Bero rather pathetically includes Jagar Tharn in his list of underachieving Battlemages.

Even if he had found four excellent examples from history of Battlemages casting spells outside their School -- and he didn't -- he would only have anecdotal evidence, which isn't enough to support an argument. I could easily find four examples of illusionists casting healing spells, or nightblades teleporting. There is a time and a place for everything.""},{""text1"":""Bero's argument, built on this shaky ground, is that the School of Destruction is not a true school. He calls it \""narrow and shallow\"" as an avenue of study, and its students impatient, with megalomaniac tendencies. How can one respond to this? Someone who knows nothing about casting a spell of Destruction criticizing the School for being too simple? Summarizing the School of Destruction as learning how to do the \""maximum amount of damage in the minimum amount of time\"" is clearly absurd, and he expounds on his ignorance by listing all the complicated factors studied in his own School of Illusion.""},{""text1"":""Allow me in response to list the factors studied in the School of Destruction. The means of delivering the spell matters more in the School of Destruction than any other school, whether it is cast at a touch, at a range, in concentric circles, or cast once to be triggered later. What forces must be reigned in to cast the spell: fire, lightning, or frost? And what are the advantages and dangers of each? What are the responses from different targets from the assault of different spells of destruction? What are the possible defenses and how may they be assailed? What environmental factors must be taken into consideration? What are the advantages of a spell of delayed damage? Bero suggests that the School of Destruction cannot be subtle, yet he forgets about all the Curses that fall under the mantle of the school, sometimes affecting generation after generation in subtle yet sublime ways.""},{""text1"":""The School of Alteration is a distinct and separate entity from the School of Destruction, and Bero's argument that they should be merged into one is patently ludicrous. He insists -- again, a man who knows nothing about the Schools of Alteration and Destruction, is the one insisting this -- that \""damage\"" is part of the changing of reality dealt with by the spells of Alteration. The implication is that Levitation, to list a spell of Alteration, is a close cousin of Shock Bolt, a spell of Destruction. It would make as much sense to say that the School of Alteration, being all about the actuality of change, should absorb the School of Illusion, being all about the appearance of change.""},{""text1"":""It certainly isn't a coincidence that a master of the School of Illusion cast this attack on the School of Destruction.

That would never be me, I vowed.""},{""text1"":""\tWith my letter from the Empress in hand, this time I would have the full cooperation of the Imperial authorities. No more need to worry about attacks from superstitious locals. But where should I look next? The ruins at Kemel-Ze were the obvious choice. Unlike Raled-Makai, getting to the ruins would not be a problem. Also known as the \""Cliff City\"", Kemel-Ze lies on the mainland side of the Vvardenfel Rift, sprawling down the sheer coastal cliff. Travelers from the east coast of Vvardenfel often visit the site by boat, and it can also be reached overland from the nearby villages without undue hardship.""},{""text1"":""\tOnce my expedition had assembled in Seyda Neen, with the usual tedious complications involved in operating in this half-civilized land, we set out for the village of Marog near the ruins, where we hoped to hire a party of diggers. My interpreter, Tuen Panai, an unusually jolly fellow for a Dark Elf who I had hired in Seyda Neen at the recommendation of the local garrison commander, assured me that the local villagers would be very familiar with Kemel-Ze, having looted the site for generations. Incidentally, Ten Penny (as we soon came to call him, to his constant amusement) proved invaluable and I would recommend him without hesitation to any of my colleagues who were planning similar expeditions to the wilds of Morrowind.""},{""text1"":""\tAt Marog, we ran into our first trouble. The hetman of the village, a reserved, elegant old fellow, seemed willing to cooperate, but the local priest (a representative of the absurd religion they have here, worshiping something called the Tribunal who they claim actually live in palaces in Morrowind) was fervently against us excavating the ruins. He looked likely to sway the villagers to his side with his talk of \""religious taboos\"", but I waved the Empress's letter under his nose and mentioned something about my friend the garrison commander at Seyda Neen and he quieted right down. No doubt this was just a standard negotiating tactic arranged among the villagers to increase their pay. In any event, once the priest had stalked off muttering to himself, no doubt calling down curses upon the heads of the foreign devils, we soon had a line of villagers eager to sign on to the expedition.""},{""text1"":""\tWhile my assistant was working out the mundane details of contracts, supplies, etc., Master Arum and I rode on to the ruins. By land, they can only be reached using narrow paths that wind down the face of the cliff from above, where any misstep threatens to send one tumbling into the sea foaming about the jagged rocks below. The city's original entrance to the surface must have been in the part of the city to the northeast - the part that fell into the sea long ago when the eruption of Red Mountain created this mind-bogglingly vast crater. After successfully navigating the treacherous path, we found ourselves in a large chamber, open to the sky on one side, disappearing into the darkness on the other. As we stepped forward, our boots crunched on piles of broken metal, as common in Dwarven ruins as potsherds in other ancient sites. This was obviously where the looters brought their finds from deeper levels, stripping off the valuable outer casings of the Dwarven mechanisms and leaving their innards here - easier than lugging the intact mechanisms back up to the top of the cliff. I laughed to myself, thinking of the many warriors unwittingly walking around Tamriel with pieces of Dwarven mechanisms on their backs. For that, of course, is what most \""Dwarven armor\"" really is - just the armored shells of ancient mechanical men. I sobered when I thought of how exceedingly valuable an intact mechanism would be. This place was obviously full of Dwarven devices, judging from the litter covering the floor of this vast chamber - or had been, I reminded myself. Looters had been working over this site for centuries. Just the casing alone would be worth a small fortune, sold as armor. Most Dwarven armor is made of mismatched pieces from various devices, hence its reputation for being bulky and unwieldy. But a matched set from an intact mechanism is worth more than its weight in gold, for the pieces all fit together smoothly and the wearer hardly notices the bulk. Of course, I had no intention of destroying my finds for armor, no matter how valuable. I would bring it back to the Society for scientific study. I imagined the astonished cries of my colleagues as I unveiled it at my next lecture, and smiled again.""},{""text1"":""\tI picked up a discarded gear from the piles at my feet. It still gleamed brightly, as if new-made, the Dwarven alloys resisting the corrosion of time. I wondered what secrets remained hidden in the maze of chambers that lay before me, defying the efforts of looters, waiting to gleam again in the light they had not seen in long eons. Waiting for me. It remained only to find them! With an impatient gesture to Master Arum to follow, I strode forward into the gloom.""},{""text1"":""\tMaster Arum, Ten Penny and I spent several days exploring the ruins while my assistants set up camp at the top of the cliff and hauled supplies and equipment from the village. I was looking for a promising area to begin excavation -- a blocked passage or corridor untouched by looters that might lead to completely untouched areas of the ruins.""},{""text1"":""\tWe found two such areas early on, but soon discovered that the many winding passages bypassed the blockage and gave access to the rooms behind. Nevertheless, even these outer areas, for the most part stripped clean of artifacts by generations of looters, were full of interest to the professional archaeologist. Behind a massive bronze door, burst from its hinges by some ancient turmoil of the earth, we discovered a large chamber filled with exquisite wall-carvings, which impressed even the jaded Ten Penny, who claimed to have explored every Dwarven ruin in Morrowind. They seemed to depict an ancient ritual of some kind, with a long line of classically-bearded Dwarven elders processing down the side walls, all seemingly bowing to the giant form of a god carved into the front wall of the chamber, which was caught in the act of stepping forth from the crater of a mountain in a cloud of smoke or steam. According to Master Arum, there are no known depictions of Dwarven religious rituals, so this was an exciting find indeed. I set a team to work prying the carved panels from the wall, but they were unable to even crack the surface. On closer examination the chamber appeared to be faced with a metallic substance with the texture and feel of stone, impervious to any of our tools. I considered having Master Arum try his blasting magic on the walls, but decided that the risk of destroying the carvings was too great. Much as I would have preferred to bring them back to the Imperial City, I had to settle for taking rubbings of the carvings. If my colleagues in the Society showed enough interest, I was sure a specialist could be found, perhaps a master alchemist, who could find a way to safely remove the panels.""},{""text1"":""\tI found another curious room at the top of a long winding stair, barely passable due to the fall of rubble from the roof. At the top of the stair was a domed chamber with a large ruined mechanism at its center. Painted constellations were still visible in some places on the surface of the dome. Master Arum and I agreed that this must have been some kind of observatory, and the mechanism was therefore the remains of a Dwarven telescope. To remove it from ruins down the narrow stairway would require its complete disassembly (which fact no doubt had preserved it from the attention of looters), so I decided to leave it in place for the time being. The existence of this observatory suggested, however, that this room had once been above the surface. Closer examination of the structure revealed that this was indeed a building, not an excavated chamber. The only other doorways from the room were completely blocked, and careful measurements from the top of the cliff to the entry room and then to the observatory revealed that we were still more than 250 feet below the present ground level. A sobering reminder of the forgotten fury of Red Mountain.""},{""text1"":""\tThis discovery led us to focus our attentions downward. Since we now knew approximately where the ancient surface lay, we could rule out many of the higher blocked passages. One wide passage, impressively flanked with carven pillars, particularly drew my interest. It ended in a massive rockfall, but we could see where looters had begun and then abandoned a tunnel through this debris. With my team of diggers and Master Arum's magery to assist, I believed we could succeed where our predecessors had failed. I therefore set my team of Dark Elves to work on clearing the passage, relieved finally to be beginning the real exploration of Kemel-Ze. Soon, I hoped, my boots would be stirring up dust that had lain undisturbed since the dawn of time.""},{""text1"":""\tWith this exciting prospect before me, I may have driven my diggers a bit too hard. Ten Penny reported that they were beginning to grumble about the long days, and that some were talking of quitting. Knowing from experience that nothing puts heart back into these Dark Elves like a taste of the lash, I had the ringleaders whipped and the rest confined to the ruins until they had finished clearing the passageway. Thank Stendarr for my foresight in requisitioning a few legionnaires from Seyda Neen! They were sullen at first, but with the promise of an extra day's wages when they broke through, they soon set to work with a will. While these measures may sound harsh to my readers back in the comforts of civilization, let me assure you that there is no other way to get these people to stick to a task.""},{""text1"":""\tThe blockage was much worse than I had first thought, and in the end it took almost two weeks to clear the passage. The diggers were as excited as I was when their picks finally broke through the far end into emptiness, and we shared a round of the local liquor together (a foul concoction, in truth) to show that all was forgiven. I could hardly restrain my eagerness as they enlarged the hole to allow entry into the chamber beyond. Would the passage lead to entire new levels of the ancient city, filled with artifacts left by the vanished Dwarves? Or would it be only a dead end, some side passage leading nowhere? My excitement grew as I slid through the hole and crouched for a moment in the darkness beyond. From the echoing sounds of the stones rattling beneath my feet, I was in a large room. Perhaps very large. I stood up carefully, and unhooded my lantern. As the light flooded the chamber, I looked around in astonishment. Here were wonders beyond even my wildest dreams!""},{""text1"":""\tAs the light from my lamp filled the chamber beyond the rock fall, I looked around in astonishment. Everywhere was the warm glitter of Dwarven alloys. I had found an untouched section of the ancient city! My heart pounding with excitement, I looked around me. The room was vast, the roof soaring up into darkness beyond the reach of my lamp, the far end lost in shadows with only a tantalizing glimmer hinting at treasures not yet revealed. Along each wall stood rows of mechanical men, intact except for one oddity: their heads had been ritually removed and placed on the floor at their feet. This could mean only one thing -- I had discovered the tomb of a great Dwarven noble, maybe even a king! Burials of this type had been discovered before, most famously by Ransom's expedition to Hammerfell, but no completely intact tomb had ever been found. Until now.""},{""text1"":""\tBut if this was truly a royal burial, where was the tomb? I stepped forward gingerly, the rows of headless bodies standing silently as they had for eons, their disembodied eyes seeming to watch me as I passed. I had heard wild tales of the Curse of the Dwarves, but had always laughed it off as superstition. But now, breathing the same air as the mysterious builders of this city, which had lain undisturbed since the cataclysm that spelled their doom, I felt a twinge of fear. There was some power here, I felt, something malevolent that resented my presence. I stopped for a moment and listened. All was silent.""},{""text1"":""\tExcept... it seemed I heard a faint hiss, regular as breathing. I fought down a sudden surge of panic. I was unarmed, not thinking of danger in my haste to explore past the blocked passage. Sweat dripped down my face as I scanned the gloom for any movement. The room was warm, I suddenly noticed, much warmer than the rest of the labyrinth thus far. My excitement returned. Could I have found a section of the city still connected to a functioning steam grid? Pipes ran along the walls, as in all sections of the city. I walked over and placed my hand on one. It was hot, almost too hot to touch! Now I saw that in places where the ancient piping had corroded, small jets of steam were escaping -- the sound I had heard. I laughed at my own credulity.""},{""text1"":""\tI now advanced quickly to the far end of the room, giving a cheerful salute to the ranks of mechanical soldiers who had appeared so menacing only moments before. I smiled with triumph as the light swept back the darkness of centuries to reveal the giant effigy of a Dwarven king standing on a raised dais, his metal hand clutching his rod of office. This was the prize indeed! I circled the dais slowly, admiring the craftsmanship of the ancient Dwarves. The golden king stood twenty feet tall under a freestanding domed cupola, his long upswept beard jutting forward proudly as his glittering metal eyes seemed to follow me. But my superstitious mood had passed, and I gazed benevolently on the old Dwarven king. My king, as I had already begun to think of him. I stepped onto the dais to get a better look at the sculpted armor. Suddenly the eyes of the figure opened and it raised a mailed fist to strike!""},{""text1"":""\tI leaped to one side as the golden arm came crashing down, striking sparks from the steps where I had stood a moment before. With a hiss of steam and the whir of gears, the giant figure stepped ponderously out from under its canopy and strode towards me with frightening speed, its eyes tracking me as I scrambled backwards. I dodged behind a pillar as the fist whistled down again. I had dropped my lantern in the confusion, and now I crept into the darkness outside the pool of light, hoping to slip between the headless mechanisms and thus escape back to the safety of the passageway. Where had the monster gone? You would think that a twenty-foot golden kind would be hard to miss, but he was nowhere to be seen. The guttering lamp only illuminated a small part of the room. He could be hiding anywhere in the gloom. I crawled faster. Without warning, the dim ranks of Dwarven soldiers in front of me went flying as the monstrous guardian loomed before me. He had cut off my escape! As I dodged backwards, blow after blow whistled down as the implacable machine followed me relentlessly, driving me into the far corner of the room. At last there was nowhere left for me to go. My back was to the wall. I glared up at my foe, determined to die on my feet. The huge fists lifted for one final blow.""},{""text1"":""\tThe room blazed with sudden light. Bolts of purple energy crackled across the metal carapace of the Dwarven monster, and it halted, half-turning to meet this new threat. Master Arum had come! I was about to raise a cheer when the giant figure turned back to me, unharmed by the lightning bolt hurled by Master Arum, determined to destroy this first intruder. I shouted out \""Steam! Steam!\"" as the giant raised his fist to crush me into the floor. There was a hiss and a gust of bitter cold and I looked up. The monster was now covered with a shell of ice, frozen in the very moment of dispatching me. Master Arum had understood. I leaned against the wall with relief.""},{""text1"":""\tThe ice cracked above me. The giant golden king stood before me, the shell of ice falling away, his head swiveling towards me in triumph. Was there no stopping this Dwarven monstrosity?! But then the light faded from his eyes, and his arms dropped to his sides. The magical frost had worked, cooling its steam-driven energy.""},{""text1"":""\tAs Master Arum and the diggers crowded around me, congratulating me on my narrow escape, my thoughts drifted. I imagined my return to the Imperial City, and I knew that this would be my greatest triumph yet. How could I possibly top this find? Perhaps it was time to move on. Recovering the fabled Eye of Argonia... now that would be a coup! I smiled to myself, reveling in the glory of the moment but already planning my next adventure.""}]"

It is a scholarly retelling of a tradition transmitted through the Ashlanders concerning the battle at Red Mountain and subsequent events. The Ashlanders associate this tale with the telling of Alandro Sul, a shield-companion of Nerevar who came to live among the Ashlanders after the death of Nerevar and during the ascension of the Tribunal. There are many variant treatments of this story, but the primary elements are consistent throughout the tradition. The murder of Nerevar, the tragic fate of Dagoth Ur, and the profane source of the Tribunal's divine power are denied by Temple doctrine as ignorant Ashlander superstition, and not widely known among civilized Dunmer.]""},{""text1"":""Resdayn, present day Morrowind, was contested ground between two very different types of mer: the Chimer, who worshipped Daedra, and the Dwemer, who worshipped a profane and secret power. These two people warred with each other constantly until their lands were invaded by a young, vibrant, and violent alien culture, the Nords.""},{""text1"":""Two heroes, one from the Chimer and one from the Dwemer, Indoril Nerevar and Dumac Dwarf-Orc, made peace between their people and together ousted the alien invaders. Then these two heroes worked long and hard to maintain that peace thereafter, though their counselors thought it could not last or, worse, that it shouldn't. Nerevar's queen and his generals-- Almalexia, Sotha Sil, Vivec-- told him to claim all Resdayn for his own. But Nerevar would not listen, for he remembered his friendship with Dumac. There would be only peace.""},{""text1"":""Until Dagoth-Ur arrived. House Dagoth had discovered the source of the profane and secret power of the Dwemer: the legendary Heart of Lorkhan, which Dumac's people had used to make themselves immortal and beyond the measure of the gods. In fact, one of the their high priests, Kagrenac, was building a New God so that the Dwemer could claim Resdayn for their own.""},{""text1"":""The Tribunal urged Nerevar again to make war on the Dwarves. Nerevar was troubled. He went to Dumac, his friend of old, and asked if what Dagoth-Ur said was true. But Kagrenac and the high priests of the Dwemer had kept their New God secret from their King, and Dumac said the Dwemer were innocent of any wrongdoing. Nerevar was troubled again and made pilgrimage to Holamayan, the sacred temple of Azura, who confirmed that all that Dagoth-Ur said was indeed true and that the New God of the Dwemer should be destroyed for the safety of not only Resdayn, but for the whole world. When Nerevar went back and told his Tribunal what the goddess had said, his queen and generals felt themselves proved aright and again counseled him to war. There were reasons that the Dwemer and Chimer had hated each other forever.""},{""text1"":""Finally, Nerevar, angered that his friend Dumac would lie to him, went back to Vvardenfell. This time the Chimer King was arrayed in arms and armor and had his hosts around him, and he spoke harshly to Dumac Dwarf-Orc, King of Red Mountain. \""You must give up your worship of the Heart of Lorkhan or I shall forget our friendship and the deeds that were accomplished in its name!\"" And Dumac, who still knew nothing of Kagrenac's New God, but proud and protective as ever of his people, said, \""We shall not relinquish that which has been our way for years beyond reckoning, just as the Chimer will not relinquish their ties to the Lords and Ladies of Oblivion. And to come at my door in this way, arrayed in arms and armor and with your hosts around you, tells me you have already forgotten our friendship. Stand down, my sweet Nerevar, or I swear by the fifteen-and-one golden tones I shall kill you and all your people.\""""},{""text1"":""And so the Chimer and Dwemer went to war. The Dwemer were well-defended by their fortress at Red Mountain, but the bravery and cleverness of Nerevar's queen and generals drew most of Dumac's armies out into the field and kept them there, so that Nerevar and Dagoth-Ur could make their way into the Heart Chamber by secret means. There, Nerevar met Dumac and the Dwarf King and they both fell from grievous wounds. Dagoth-Ur slew Kagrenac and took the tools the Dwemer used to tap the power of the Heart. He went to his dying lord Nerevar and asked him what to do with these tools. And Nerevar summoned Azura again, and she showed them how to use the tools to separate the power of the Heart from the Dwemer people.""},{""text1"":""And on the fields, the Tribunal and their armies watched as the Dwemer turned into dust all around them as their stolen immortality was taken away.""},{""text1"":""Back in Red Mountain, Nerevar told Dagoth-Ur to protect the tools and the Heart Chamber until he returned. Dagoth-Ur said, \""But shouldn't we destroy these tools at once, so that they might never be used for evil again?\"" But Nerevar was confused by his wounds and his sorrow (for he still loved Dumac and the Dwemer people) and so went to the fields outside of Red Mountain to confer with his queen and his generals, who had foreseen that this war would come and whose counsel he would not ignore again. \""I will ask the Tribunal what we shall do with them, for they have had wisdom in the past that I had not. Stay here, loyal Dagoth-Ur, until I return.\""""},{""text1"":""Then Nerevar told his queen and generals all that had transpired under Red Mountain and how the Dwemer had used special tools to turn their people into immortals and of the wondrous power of the Heart of Lorkhan. The Tribunal decided that the Chimer should learn how to use this power so that Nerevar might claim Resdayn and the world for their people. Nerevar did not expect or want this, so he asked his queen and generals to help him summon Azura yet again for her guidance. But the Tribunal had become as greedy as Kagrenac upon hearing of the power of the Heart and they coveted it. They made ritual as if to summon Azura as Nerevar wanted but Almalexia used poisoned candles and Sotha Sil used poisoned robes and Vivec used poisoned invocations. Nerevar was murdered.""},{""text1"":""Then Azura came forth anyway and cursed the Tribunal for their foul deeds. She told them that she would use her powers over dusk and dawn to make sure Nerevar would come back and make things right again. But the Tribunal laughed at her and said that soon they would be gods themselves and that the Chimer people would forget their old ways of worship. And Azura knew this would be true and that it would take a long time before her power might bring Nerevar back. \""What you have done here today is foul beyond measure and you will grow to regret it, for the lives of gods are not what mortals think and matters that weigh only years to mortals weigh on gods forever.\"" And so that they might know forever their wicked deeds Azura changed the Chimer into Dunmer, and their skin turned ashen and their eyes into fire. \""Let this mark remind you of your true selves who, like ghouls, fed on the nobility, heroism, and trust of their king.\""""},{""text1"":""And then the Tribunal went into Red Mountain and met with Dagoth-Ur. Dagoth-Ur saw what had been done, for his skin had changed as well, and he tried to avenge the death of Nerevar but to no avail. He was driven off and thought dead. The Tribunal found the tools he had been guarding and, through study of Kagrenac's methods, turned themselves into gods.""},{""text1"":""Thousands of years after their apotheosis, the Tribunal are still the gods of Morrowind and the old ways of worship are remembered only by a few.

Every slave he bought on the day he bought him or her was soundly whipped in the courtyard for a period of one to three hours, depending on the individual degree of independent spirit.  The whip he used -- or had his castellan use -- was of wet, knotted cloth, which regularly drew blood but very seldom maimed.  To his great satisfaction and personal pride, few slaves ever needed to be whipped more than once.  The memory of their first day, and the sight and sound of every subsequent slave's first day, stayed with them throughout their lives.""},{""text1"":""When Brin bought his first Bosmer slave, he ordered his castellan to whip him only for an hour.

Dob was clearly ill suited for work in the mines or in the fields, but he seemed presentable enough for domestic service.""},{""text1"":""Dob did his work quietly and tolerably well.

The Bosmer had been a highwayman, though not one of any great notoriety, before he had been caught and sold into slavery as punishment.  It seemed so extraordinary that a quiet fellow like Dob, who always looked respectfully downward at the sight of his superiors, could have been a criminal.  Brin made up his mind to question him about it.""},{""text1"":""\""You must have used some sort of weapon when you were robbing all those pilgrims and merchants,\"" Brin grinned as he watched Dob mop.""},{""text1"":""\""Yes, sedura,\"" Dob replied humbly. \""A bow.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Of course.

He embarrassed his father's pride, but the personality defect seemed ideally suited to the bow.\nBrin had his castellan purchase a finely wrought bow, several quivers of arrows, and ordered targets to be set up in the wildflower field next to the plantation house.

Airen Coribael himself was there, guarding a squirming sack which  Baranat assumed either contained Lady Genevrah or several large cats.

But on the seventh day, as he was preparing his  Killing Blow, he suddenly stopped, eyes wide open. The blood drained  from his face, and he realized the trap he had stepped into.

Further complicating matters was the refusal of Indoril, Dres, Hlaalu, and Telvanni to garrison the western borders; Indoril and Dres proposed, rather than defend the western border, instead to withdraw to the interior and fight a guerilla war.

Indoril swore they would resist to the death, with the loyal support of Dres, while Redoran, grateful for a graceful excuse to avoid facing the legions unsupported, joined with Hlaalu in welcoming the agreement.

The only organization then closest in aim and structure to what we know today as the Mages Guild was the Psijic Order of the Isle of Artaeum. At the time, magic was something to be learned by individuals, or at most within intimate covens. Mages were, if not actually hermits, usually quite solitary.""},{""text1"":""\tThe Psijic Order served the rulers of Summurset Isle as counsellors, and chose its members through a complex, ritualized method not understood by outsiders. Its purposes and goals likewise went unpublished, and detractors attributed the worst evils as the source of the Order's power. Actually, the religion of the old Order could be described as ancestor worship, an increasingly unfashionable philosophy in the Second Era.""},{""text1"":""\tWhen Vanus Galerion, a Psijic of Artaeum and student of the famed Iachesis, began collecting magic-users from around Summurset Isle, he attracted the animosity of all. He was operating out of the urban center of Firsthold, and there was a common (and not entirely unfounded) attitude that magical experiments should be conducted only in unpopulated areas. Even more shocking, Galerion proposed to make magical items, potions, and even spells available to any member of the general public who could afford to pay. No longer was magic to be limited either to the aristocracy or intelligentsia.""},{""text1"":""\tGalerion was brought before Iachesis and the King of Firsthold, Rilis XII, and made to state the intentions of the fraternity he was forming. The fact that Galerion's speech to Rilis and Iachesis was not recorded for posterity is doubtless a tragedy, though it does afford opportunity for historians to amuse one another with speculation about the lies and persuasions Galerion might have used to found the ubiquitous organization. The charter, at any rate, was approved.""},{""text1"":""\tAlmost immediately after the Guild was formed, the question of security had to be addressed. The Isle of Artaeum did not require force of arms to shield it from invaders -- when the Psijic Order does not wish someone to land on the Isle, it and all its inhabitants simply become insubstantial. The new Mages Guild, by contrast, had to hire guards. Galerion soon discovered what the Tamrielan nobility has known for thousands of years: Money alone does not buy loyalty. The knightly Order of the Lamp was formed the following year.""},{""text1"":""\tLike a tree from an acorn, the Mages Guild grew branches all over Summurset Isle and gradually the mainland of Tamriel. There are numerous records of superstitious or sensibly fearful rulers forbidding the Guild in their domains, but their heirs or heirs' heirs eventually recognized the wisdom of allowing the Guild free rein. The Mages Guild has become a powerful force in Tamriel, a dangerous foe if a somewhat disinterested ally. There have been only a few rare incidents of the Mages Guild actually becoming involved in local political struggles. On these occasions, the Guild's participation has been the ultimate decider in the conflict.""},{""text1"":""\tAs begun by Vanus Galerion, the Mages Guild as an institution is presided over by a supreme council of six Archmagisters. Each Guildhall is run by a Guildmagister, assisted by a twofold counsel, the Master of Incunabula and the Master at Arms. The Master of Incunabula presides over an additional counsel of two mages, the Master of Academia and the Master of the Scrye. The Master at Arms also has a counsel of two, the Master of Initiates and the Palatinus, the leader of the local chapter of the Order of the Lamp.""},{""text1"":""\tOne need not be a member of the Mages Guild to know that this carefully contrived hierarchy is often nothing more than a chimera. As Vanus Galerion himself said bitterly, leaving Tamriel to travel to other lands, “The Guild has become nothing more than an intricate morass of political infighting.”""}]"

Vivec is easily the most popular of them all. Vivec is also the most public, for he is the beloved Warrior-Poet of the True People, paradoxically beautiful and bloody. Vivec is an artistic violence. Vivec is represented in Temple literature and liturgy as one of the divine kings of Morrowind. He guards the sacred Velothi subcontinent of Vvardenfell, and stands guard over Red Mountain, the gate to hell. He is part of the holy Tribunal, a god of the New Temple, and an aspect of the blessed and righteous ALMSIVI.""},{""text1"":""This explicit presentation of Vivec the Guardian God-King and Warrior-Poet is the one most accessible and familiar to Westerners. However, it is important to remember that Vivec is also known to the Dunmer as the transcendent evolution of the daedra that anticipated him, Black Hands Mephala, a foundation figure of the earliest Chimer. This darker side of Vivec does not appear in the popular literature and liturgy, but is instinctively understood and accepted by the Dunmer as an integral part of Vivec's divine aspect. A more complete appreciation of the complex nature of Vivec requires an understanding of the nature of Vivec's Anticipation, Mephala, and the darker themes represented by this Daedra Lord's modes and motivations.""},{""text1"":""Each of the three Tribunes of the Temple were represented in the dawn of Chimeri culture by their Anticipations. These Anticipations are known to the West as the sinister Daedra Lords Azura, Boethiah, and Mephala. In Temple theology, however, Azura is the Anticipation of Sotha Sil, the Mage-Lord of Almsivi. Boethiah is the Anticipation of Almalexia, Almsivi's Mother and Lady. Mephala is the Anticipation of Vivec. According to legend, under the guidance of these three Daedra Lords, a discontented throng of Altmer transformed themselves into a new people and founded a new land. And while Boethiah, the so-called Prince of Plots, provided the revolutionary methods needed to bring about this transformation, Mephala was the shadowy implementer of those methods.""},{""text1"":""As known in the West, Mephala is the demon of murder, sex, and secrets. All of these themes contain subtle aspects and violent ones (assassination/genocide, courtship/orgy, tact/poetic truths); Mephala is understood paradoxically to contain and integrate these contradictory themes. And all these subtle undercurrents and contradictions are present in the Dunmer concepts of Vivec, even if they are not explicitly described and explained in Temple doctrine.""},{""text1"":""The Dunmer do not envision Lord Vivec as a creature of murder, sex, and secrets. Rather, they conceive of Lord Vivec as benevolent king, guardian warrior, poet-artist. But, at the same time, unconsciously, they accept the notion of darker, hidden currents beneath Vivec's benevolent aspects.""},{""text1"":""For example, one of the most striking persistent myths associated with Vivec is the story that Vivec conspired with his co-rulers Almalexia and Sotha Sil in the murder of Lord Nerevar, the greatest of Dunmer heroes and generals. The story is derived from Ashlander oral tradition, and is flatly contradicted by all Temple traditions. Nonetheless, the tale is firmly established in the Dunmer imagination, as if to say, \""Of course Vivec would never have conspired to murder Lord Nerevar, but it happened so long ago... who can know the truth?\""""},{""text1"":""The public face of Vivec is benign, sensitive, compassionate, and protective of his followers. At the same time, the Dunmer seem irrationally comfortable with the hidden aspects of Vivec, the darker components of violence, lust, and conspiracy associated the more primitive and ruthless impulses of the Anticipations.""}]"

The winged twilight is a messenger of Azura, Goddess of Dusk and Dawn. Winged twilights resemble the feral harpies of the West, though the feminine aspects of the winged twilights are more ravishing, and their long, sharp, hooked tails are immeasurably more deadly. Spider Daedra are the servants of Mephala, taking the form of spider-humanoid centaurs, with a naked upper head, torso, and arms of human proportions, mounted on the eight legs and armored carapace of a giant spider.

Carnage notwithstanding, there may be even more to death than the average Nord warrior realizes. New evidence suggests a life beyond the battlefield, where a valiant Nord may live forever, downing mead and engaging in contests of strength and skill. But in order to fully understand the possibility of a Nord's eternal life after death, one must first reexamine the legends surrounding that most wondrous of warrior's retreats - Sovngarde.""},{""text1"":""According to the ancient writings and oral traditions of the Nords, going back as far as the Late Merethic Era, there exists a place so magnificent, so honored, that the entrance lies hidden from view. Sovngarde, it is called, built by the god Shor to honor those Nords who have proven their mettle in war. Within this \""Hall of Valor\"" time as we know it has no meaning.

Not that this has stopped anyone from looking. Some Nords spend a lifetime searching for the mysterious hidden entrance to Sovngarde. Most return home sad and broken, their hearts heavy with failure.

Sovngarde, Shor told him, can be entered by any Nord who dies valiantly in honorable combat.""},{""text1"":""It is time for Nords to learn the truth. Eternal life can be theirs, without the need to spend an entire mortal life in vain pursuit of something completely unattainable. In the end, all valiant Nords can enter Sovngarde.

Only when Massitha had pulled herself back up from behind the pile of rocks, weak and bleeding, that the fight turned.

They sought to live life as their ancestors had in Skyrim -- free to kill what they wanted when they wanted, free to worship in any manner they chose.""},{""text1"":""The group braved the harsh weather and traveled south toward Lake Fjalding, where they found the perfect location for a new settlement. There they decided to construct a grand mead hall that would serve as their new home and hunting lodge. After several months of building, the companions had completed the task, and named the mead hall Thirsk.""},{""text1"":""The settlers looked upon all they had accomplished, and were truly proud of their accomplishment. But their happiness was short lived, and the settlers soon learned that not everyone celebrated the construction of Thirsk. As the mead hall was being erected, so too was the noise and commotion of construction disturbing an ancient creature that lie dormant under the ice. It was a tragic twist of irony, therefore, that as the last beam of the great hall was nailed in place, the slumbering beast did finally awaken. His ancient name was the Udyrfrykte, though the settlers knew him only as death. The Udyrfrykte came to the newly completed mead hall and wreaked vengeance upon those who had shattered the peace of his long, cold sleep. He killed without warning, without mercy, reducing the Thirsk Nords to half their number. It was the valiant sorcerer Eldrid Ice-Light who finally drove the beast back to his lair beneath the frozen lake, and used his magicka to seal the entrance with a great wall of ice. The horror was over, but the price was great. It took the settlers two months to fix the damage done by the Udyrfrykte, and with so many strong hands now gone, it was slow and tedious work.""},{""text1"":""Finally, Thirsk stood tall and proud once more. But even though the settlers had worked together to construct the mead hall and drive away the threat of the Udyrfrykte, tensions quickly grew over who would serve as their leader. Most of the men considered Hrothmund the Red their de facto chieftain, as he was the strongest and most capable of the lot. But one warrior, Drengr Bronze-Helm, disagreed. He thought himself most capable to rule over Thirsk, and loudly voiced his opposition to Hrothmund. Knowing that conflict and discord would only serve to destroy the new life they had worked so hard to create, Hrothmund the Red exercised his only true option - he swung his great axe and beheaded Drengr Bronze-Helm where he stood. The Nords appreciated more than anything a warrior's prowess in battle, and Drengr's slaying proved to them that Hrothmund was indeed most worthy to be Thirsk's chieftain. So that the other Nords would never forget he had proven his right to lead, Hrothmund placed Drengr's head on a pedestal in the center of Thirsk's main hall, for all to see.""},{""text1"":""And so began Thirsk's most time-honored tradition. Any warrior, regardless of race or sex, could claim leadership of the mead hall by displaying the most impressive battle trophy on the great hall's pedestal. So long as the spirit of Hrothmund the Red consented, that warrior would be named chieftain.""},{""text1"":""For twenty-one years Hrothmund the Red ruled over Thirsk and its residents as chieftain. With his soft voice and great axe -- which was said to be the largest weapon of its kind ever wielded by a Nord -- Hrothmund brought peace and prosperity to Thirsk. But peace proved to be Hrothmund's undoing, for the mighty Nord grew restless in the warmth and safety of the mead hall. He longed for battle and adventure, to feel the frost in his veins once more, and could ignore the call of valor no longer. When word spread of a giant, bloodthirsty white wolf terrorizing travelers in the Moesring Mountains, Hrothmund took up his great axe and set out to defeat the beast alone. The men of the mountains named him Ondjage, the Fell Wolf. The beast measured as large as an ox, with fur as white as new-fallen snow, and it was said no man or woman alive could bring Ondjage down. The words of the mountain folk proved true, for while Hrothmund did hew one leg from the Fell Wolf, Ondjage devoured the mighty Nord whole, leaving only his great axe as a grim reminder of man's failure against beast. Filled with sorrow and rage, the residents of Thirsk marched to the mountains in search of the wolf, called by them Hrothmund's Bane. Only together did they manage to slay Ondjage, and as family they feasted on his roasted flesh.""},{""text1"":""The coming of <Name>, slayer of the Udyrfrykte:""},{""text1"":""For one hundred years the mead hall of Thirsk has withstood all manner of hardship, from armed attack and fire to the equally devastating scourge of yellow tick. But nothing within that span of time could compare to the terror of the Udyrfrykte, that ancient beast who ravaged the great hall during the time of Hrothmund. The Udyrfrykte was driven away, and sealed inside his lair for what all hoped was an eternity. In time, the beast was forgotten, but the beast himself did not forget. When the lake of ice caught fire and the entrance to that long-sealed lair lay open, the Udyrfrykte walked once more upon the land. He came back to Thirsk to seek his vengeance, and vengeance he found. The fell creature killed all he could, and tore the mead hall asunder. The Udyrfrykte was driven from the mead hall, but all knew it was just a matter of time before he returned to finish the job he had started -- the complete destruction of Thirsk and all who resided within. It was then he came, a stranger to the land of Solstheim and savior to the Nords of Thirsk. His name was <Name> of the <Race> race, and he did what even the mighty Hrothmund could not. This brave warrior strode into the lair of the Udyrfrykte, faced the ancient beast, and slew him as a butcher slays a sheep! The mighty <Name> then claimed the heart of the Udyrfrykte as a battle trophy, where it remains to this day on the pedestal of Thirsk.

But while Thirsk itself did not grow, its inhabitants did, and before long the grand mead hall could not house all who wished to dwell within. So, over the years, many Nords have left Thirsk to establish their own private dwellings out in the wilderness of Solstheim, relying on the island's many caves and natural shelters. But those who left are always welcome back at Thirsk, and many return frequently to enjoy the mead hall's hospitalities. It is also important to note that although over a hundred years have passed since the group first left the Skaal village, the Skaal and Thirsk Nords have always remained civil to one another, and even trade resources on occasion.""},{""text1"":""Throughout the years, the Thirsk Nords and the Empire have entered into a simple but effective relationship: they leave each other alone and everyone is happy. Soon after arriving on Solstheim, the Imperials realized that their authority on the island was limited to Fort Frostmoth and vicinity. Solstheim was, is, and probably always will be a savage and frozen wasteland more suited to ancient Nord custom than conventional Imperial law. As long as the residents of Thirsk leave Fort Frostmoth in peace, the Imperials at Fort Frostmoth will reciprocate. In fact, the relationship between the two locations is fairly civil, and the Thirsk Nords gained considerable favor with the Empire when they delivered the Breton fugitive Alain Montrose to the garrison at Fort Frostmoth, after he attempted to hide out in Thirsk.""},{""text1"":""Within the Mead Hall, the Chieftain serves as judge, jury and executioner if necessary. The reality is that Thirsk has always been a fairly peaceful place, with camaraderie and goodwill the norm. Solstheim can be a harsh home, and the Nords of Thirsk have long realized that fighting each other isn't nearly as productive as battling the island's bears, wolves, draugrs, Rieklings, and whatever other fell creatures may roam the land. Still, there is the occasional disagreement - which more often than naught ends in bloodshed - and every few years someone gets it into his head to challenge the chieftain to a blood duel to try to gain possession of Thirsk. Generally speaking, the Nords of Thirsk are one big, happy barbarian-like family. And, like any family, they have their squabbles.""}]"

Within a fortnight, the Akaviri Potentate crumbled, to the delight of its enemies.""},{""text1"":""\tThe Dark Brotherhood has no shortage of business opportunities—an \""accounting,\"" I have been informed, is the Brotherhood's favorite euphemism for an execution. While they are officially considered an unlawful organization in every corner of the Empire, like the Thieves Guild, they are almost as universally tolerated. ""},{""text1"":""As their name suggests, the Dark Brotherhood has a history shrouded in obfuscation. Their ways are secret to those who are not themselves Brothers of the Order (\""Brother\"" is a generic term; some of their deadliest assassins are female, but they are often called Brothers as well). How they continue to exist in shadow, but be easily found by those desperate enough to pay for their services, is not the least of the mysteries surrounding them.""},{""text1"":""\tThe Dark Brotherhood sprang from a religious order, the Morag Tong, during the Second Era. The Morag Tong were worshippers of the Daedra spirit Mephala, who encouraged them to commit ritual murders. In their early years, they were as disorganized as only obscure cultists could be-there was no one to lead the band, and as a group they dared not murder anybody of any importance. This changed with the rise of the Night Mother.""},{""text1"":""\tAll leaders of the Morag Tong, and then afterward the Dark Brotherhood, have been called the Night Mother. Whether the same woman (if it is even a woman) has commanded the Dark Brotherhood since the Second Era is unknown. What is believed is that the original Night Mother developed an important doctrine of the Morag Tong-the belief that, while Mephala does grow stronger with every murder committed in her name, certain murders were better than others. Murders that came from hate pleased Mephala more than murders committed because of greed. Murders of great men and women pleased Mephala more than murders of relative unknowns.""},{""text1"":""\tWe can approximate the time this belief was adopted with the first known murder committed by the Morag Tong. In the year 324 of the Second Era, the Potentate Versidue-Shaie was murdered in his palace in what is today the Elsweyr kingdom of Senchal. In a brash move, the Night Mother announced the identity of the murderers by painting \""MORAG TONG\"" on the walls in the Potentate's own blood.""},{""text1"":""\tPrevious to that, the Morag Tong existed in relative peace, more or less like a witches' coven-occasionally persecuted but usually ignored. In remarkable synchronicity at a time when Tamriel the Arena was a fractured land, the Morag Tong was outlawed throughout the continent. Every sovereign gave the cult's elimination his highest priority. Nothing more was officially heard of them for a hundred years.""},{""text1"":""\tIt is more difficult to date the Era when the Morag Tong re-emerged as the Dark Brotherhood, especially as other guilds of assassins have sporadically appeared throughout the history of Tamriel. The first mention of the Dark Brotherhood that I have found is from the journals of the Blood Queen Arlimahera of Hegathe. She spoke of slaying her enemies by her own hand, or if necessary \""with the help of the Night Mother and her Dark Brotherhood, the secret arsenal my family has employed since my grandfather's time.\"" Arlimahera wrote this in 2E412, so one can surmise that the Dark Brotherhood had been in existence since at least 360 if her grandfather had truly made use of them.""},{""text1"":""\tThe important distinction between the Dark Brotherhood and the Morag Tong was that the Brotherhood was a business as much as it was a cult. Rulers and wealthy merchants used the order as an assassin's guild. The Brotherhood gained the obvious rewards of a profitable enterprise, as well as the secondary benefit that rulers could no longer actively persecute them: They were needed. They were purveyors of an essential commodity. Even an extremely virtuous leader would be unwise to mistreat the Brotherhood.""},{""text1"":""\tNot long after Alimahera's journal entry came perhaps the most famous series of executions in the history of the Dark Brotherhood. The Colovian Emperor-Potentate Savirien-Chorak and every one of his heirs were murdered on one bloody night in Sun's Dawn in 430. Within a fortnight, the Colovian Dynasty crumbled, to the delight of its enemies. For over four hundred years, until the advent of the Warrior Emperor Tiber Septim, chaos reigned over Tamriel. Though no comparably impressive executions have been recorded, the Brotherhood must have grown fat with gold during that interregnum.""}]"

When the victim is thus rendered unconscious, you slash his throat while still holding him from behind, and the risk of staining one's clothes with blood is practically nonexistant.""},{""text1"":""\""The classic technique, which requires less grappling than my friend's variation, is to place one hand over the victim's mouth, and then saw through the throat in three or four stroke rather like playing a violin. It requires little effort, and while there's quite a bit of blood, it all jets forward away from you.""},{""text1"":""There's no reason when one knows one is going to be slitting some throats not to take some precautions and bring some extra equipment. The best neck-hackers I know generally carry a bit of wadded cloth on the aft-side of their knives to keep blood from getting on their cuffs. It's impractical for this sort of assignment, but when you're only anticipating one or two victims, nothing beats throwing a sack over the targets head, drawing the string tight, and then supplying the killing blow or blows.\""""},{""text1"":""Imalyn laughed loudly, \""Can I see a demonstration sometime?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Very soon,\"" said Lledos. \""If Galsiah has done her job.\""""},{""text1"":""Galsiah brought out the map of the guildhouse, freshly stolen, and they began to detail out the strategy.""},{""text1"":""The last several hours had been a whirlwind to all. In less than a day, the three had met, formulated a plan, bought or stolen the necessary ingredients, and were about to execute it. Not one of the three were sure whether confidence or stupidity were driving the other two, but the fates were aligned. The guildhouse was going to be robbed.""},{""text1"":""When the sun set, Lledos, Galsiah, and Imalyn approached the Cobblers Guildhouse on the east end of town. Galsiah used her cachous of stoneflower to mask their scent from the guard wolves as the three passed over the parapets. She also acted as lead scout, and Lledos was impressed. For someone of relative inexperience, she knew her way through shadows.""},{""text1"":""Lledos's expertise was demonstrated a dozen times, and the guards were of such a diverse variety, he was able to demonstrate all the means of silent assassination he had developed over the years.""},{""text1"":""Imalyn opened the vault in his unique and systematic method. As the tumblers fell beneath his fingers, he softly sang an old dirty tavern song about the Ninety-Nine Loves of Boethiah. He said it helped him focus and organize difficult combinations. Within seconds, the vault was open and the gold was in hand.""},{""text1"":""They left the guildhouse an hour after they entered. No alarm had been raised, the gold was gone, and corpses lay pooling blood on the stone floors within.""},{""text1"":""\""Well done, my friends, well done. You learned well.\"" Lledos said as he poured the gold pieces into the specially designed compartments in his tunic's sleeves, where they held fast with no jingling or unusual bulges. \""We'll meet back at the Plot and Plaster tomorrow morning and split up the bounty.\""""},{""text1"":""The group parted ways. The only person who knew the most covert route through the city's sewer system, Lledos, slipped in through a duct and vanished below. Galsiah threw on her shawl, muddied her face to resemble an old f'lah fortune-teller, and headed north. Imalyn headed east into the park, trusting his unnatural senses to keep him away from the citywatch.""},{""text1"":""Now I teach them the greatest lesson of all, thought Lledos as he sloshed through the labyrinthine tunnels of sludge. His guar was waiting where he left it at the city gates, making a laconic lunch of the chokeweed shrub to which it had been leashed.""},{""text1"":""On the road to Vivec, he thought of Galsiah and Imalyn. Perhaps they had been caught and brought in for questioning already. It was a pity he couldn't see them undergoing interrogation. Who would break under pressure first? Imalyn was certainly the tougher of the two, but Galsiah doubtless had hidden reserves. It was merely intellectual curiousity: they thought his name was Lledos and he was meeting them at the Plot and Plaster. The authorities wouldn't therefore be looking for a Dunmer named Sathis celebrating his wealth miles and miles away in Vivec.""},{""text1"":""As he prodded his mount forward and the sun began rising, Sathis pictured Galsiah and Imalyn not undergoing interrogation, but sleeping the good deep sleep of the wicked, dreaming of how they would spend their share of the gold. Both would wake up early and rush to the Plot and Plaster. He could see them now, Imalyn laughing and carrying on, Galsiah hushing him to avoid bringing undue attention. They would take a couple flagons of greef, perhaps order a meal -- a big one -- and wait. Hours would pass, and so would their moods. The chain of reactions that every betrayed person exhibits: nervousness, doubt, bewilderment, anger.""},{""text1"":""The sun was fully risen when Sathis reached the stables of his house on the outskirts of Vivec. He reigned in his guar and filled its feed. The rest of the stalls were empty. It wouldn't be until that afternoon when his servants returned from the feast of St Rilms in Gnisis. They were good people, and he treated them well, but from past experience he knew that servants talked. If they began to connect his absences with thefts in other towns, it was only a matter of time before they would go to the authorities or blackmail him. After all, they were human. It was best in the long run to give them a week off with pay whenever he was out of town on business.""},{""text1"":""He slipped the gold into the vault in his study, and went upstairs. The schedule had been tight, but Sathis had given himself a few hours to rest before his household returned. His own bed was wonderfully soft and warm compared to the dreadful mattress he had to use at the canton in Tel Aruhn.""},{""text1"":""Sathis woke up some time later from a nightmare. For a second after he opened his eyes, he thought he could still hear Imalyn's voice nearby, singing The Ninety-Nine Loves of Boethiah. He lay still in his bed, waiting, but there was no sound except the usual creaks and groans of his old house. Afternoon sunlight came through his bedroom window in ribbons, catching dust. He closed his eyes.""},{""text1"":""The song returned, and Sathis heard the vault door in his study swing open. The smell of stoneflower filled his nose and he opened his eyes. Only a little of the afternoon sunlight could pierce the inside of the burlap sack.""},{""text1"":""A strong, feminine hand clamped over the mouth and a thumb jabbed under his chin. Just as his throat opened and his head was shoved to the side, he heard Galsiah in her typical calm voice, \""Thank you for the lesson, Sathis.\""""}]"

The occasion was the millennial celebration of the founding of the Breton Kingdom of Camlorn.  Every grand boulevard and narrow alley was strung with gold and purple banners, some plain, some marked with the heraldic symbols of the Royal Family or the various principalities and dukedoms which were vassals of the King.  Musicians played in the plazas great and small, and on every street corner was a new exotic entertainer: Redguard snake charmers, Khajiiti acrobats, magicians of genuine power and those whose flamboyant skill was equally impressive if largely illusion.""},{""text"":""The sight that drew most of the male citizens of Camlorn was the March of Beauty.  A thousand comely young women, brightly and provocatively dressed, danced their way down the long, wide main street of the city, from the Temple of Sethiete to the Royal Palace.  The menfolk jostled one another and craned their necks, picking their favorites.  It was no secret that they were all prostitutes, and after the March and the Flower Festival that evening, they would be available for more intimate business.""},{""text"":""Gyna attracted much of the attention with her tall, curvaceous figure barely covered by strips of silk and her curls of flaxen hair specked with flower petals.  In her late twenties, she wasn't the youngest of the prostitutes, but she was certainly one of the most desirable.  It was clear by her demeanor that she was used to the lascivious glances, though she was far from jaded at the sight of the city in splendor.  Compared to the squalid quarter of Daggerfall where she made her home, Camlorn at the height of celebration seemed so unreal.  And yet, what was even stranger was how, at the same time, familiar it all looked, though she had never been there before.""},{""text"":""The King's daughter Lady Jyllia rode out of the palace gates, and immediately cursed her misfortune.  She had completely forgotten about the March of Beauty.  The streets were snarled, at a standstill.  It would take hours to wait for the March to pass, and she had promised her old nurse Ramke a visit in her house south of the city.  Jyllia thought for a moment, picturing in her mind the arrangement of streets in the city, and devised a shortcut to avoid the main street and the March.""},{""text"":""For a few minutes she felt very clever as she wound her way through tight, curving side streets, but presently she came upon temporary structures, tents and theaters set up for the celebration, and had to improvise a new path.  In no time at all, she was lost in the city where she had lived all but five years of her life.""},{""text"":""Peering down an alley, she saw the main avenue crowded with the March of Beauty.  Hoping that it was the tale end, and desirous not to be lost again, Lady Jyllia guided her horse toward the festival.  She did not see the snake-charmer at the mouth of the alley, and when his pet hissed and spread its hood, her charge reared up in fear.""},{""text"":""The women in the parade gasped and surged back at the sight, but Lady Jyllia quickly calmed her stallion down.  She looked abashed at the spectacle she had caused.\n\""My apologies, ladies,\"" she said with a mock military salute.""},{""text"":""\""It's all right, madam,\"" said a blonde in silk. \""We'll be out of your way in a moment.\""""},{""text"":""Jyllia stared as the March passed her.  Looking at that whore had been like looking in a mirror.  The same age, and height, and hair, and eyes, and figure, almost exactly.  The woman looked back at her, and it seemed as if she was thinking the same thing.""},{""text"":""And so Gyna was.  The old witches who sometimes came in to Daggerfall had sometimes spoke of doppelgangers, spirits that assumed the guise of their victims and portended certain death.  Yet the experience had not frightened her: it seemed only one more strangely familiar aspect of the alien city.  Before the March had danced it way into the palace gates, she had all but forgotten the encounter.""},{""text"":""The prostitutes crushed into the courtyard, as the King himself came to the balcony to greet them.  At his side was his chief bodyguard, a battlemage by the look of him.  As for the King himself, he was a handsome man of middle age, rather unremarkable, but Gyna was awed at the sight of him.  A dream, perhaps.  Yes, that was it: she could see him as she had dreamt of him, high above her as he was now, bending now to kiss her.  Not a one of lust as she had experienced before, but one of small fondness, a dutiful kiss.""},{""text"":""\""Dear ladies, you have filled the streets of the great capitol of Camlorn with your beauty,\"" cried the King, forcing a silence on the giggling, murmuring assembly.  He smiled proudly.  His eyes met Gyna's and he stopped, shaken.  For an eternity, they stayed locked together before His Highness recovered and continued his speech.""},{""text"":""Afterwards, while the women were all en route back to their tents to change into their costumes for the evening, one of the older prostitutes approached Gyna: \""Did you see how the King looked at you?  If you're smart, you'll be the new royal mistress before this celebration ends.\""""},{""text"":""\""I've seen looks of hunger before, and that wasn't one of them,\"" laughed Gyna. \""I'd wager he thought I was someone else, like that lady who tried to run us over with her horse.  She's probably his kin, and he thought she had dressed up like a courtesan and joined the March of Beauty.  Can you imagine the scandal?\""""},{""text"":""When they arrived at the tents, they were greeted by a stocky, well-dressed young man with a bald pate and a commanding presence of authority.  He introduced himself as Lord Strale, ambassador to the Emperor himself, and their chief patron.  It was Strale who had hired them, on the Emperor's behalf, as a gift to the King and the kingdom of Camlorn.""},{""text"":""\""The March of Beauty is but a precursor to the Flower Festival tonight,\"" he said.  Unlike the King, he did not have to yell to be heard.  His voice was loud and precise in its natural modulations. \""I expect each of you to perform well, and justify the significant expense I've suffered bringing you all the way up here.  Now hurry, you must be dressed and in position on Cavilstyr Rock before the sun goes down.\""""},{""text"":""The ambassador needn't have worried.  The women were all professionals, experts at getting dressed and undressed with none of the time-consuming measures less promiscuous females required.  His manservant Gnorbooth offered his assistance, but found he had little to do.  Their costumes were simplicity itself: soft, narrow sheets with a hole for their heads.  Not even a belt was required, so the gowns were open at the sides exposing the frame of their skin.""},{""text"":""So it was long before the sun had set that the prostitutes turned dancers were at Cavilstyr Rock.  It was a great, wide promontory facing the sea, and for the occasion of the Festival of Flowers, a large circle of unlit torches and covered baskets had been arranged.  As early as they were, a crowd of spectators had already arrived.  The women gathered in the center of the circle and waited until it was time.""},{""text"":""Gyna watched the crowd as it grew, and was not surprised when she saw the lady from the March approaching, hand-in-hand with a very old, very short white-haired woman.  The old woman was distracted, pointing out islands out at sea.  The blonde lady seemed nervous, unsure of what to say.  Gyna was used to dealing with uneasy clients, and spoke first.""},{""text"":""\""Good to see you again, madam.  I am Gyna of Daggerfall.\""""},{""text"":""\""I'm glad you bear me no ill will because of the whores, I mean horse,\"" the lady laughed, somewhat relieved. \""I am Lady Jyllia Raze, daughter of the King.\""""},{""text"":""\""I always thought that daughters of kings were called princess,\"" smiled Gyna.""},{""text"":""\""In Camlorn, only when they are heirs to the throne.  I have a younger brother from my father's new wife whom he favors,\"" Jyllia replied.  She felt her head swim.  It was madness, speaking to a common prostitute, talking of family politics so intimately. \""Relative to that subject, I must ask you something very peculiar.  Have you ever heard of the Princess Talara?\""""},{""text"":""Gyna thought a moment: \""The name sounds somewhat familiar.  Why would I have?\""""},{""text"":""\""I don't know.  It was a name I just thought you might recognize,\"" sighed Lady Jyllia. \""Have you been to Camlorn before?\""""},{""text"":""\""If I did, it was when I was very young,\"" said Gyna, and suddenly she felt it was her turn to be trusting.  Something about the Lady Jyllia's friendly and forthcoming manner touched her. \""To be honest, I don't remember anything at all of my childhood before I was nine or ten.  Perhaps I was here with my parents, whoever they were, when I was a little girl.  I tell you, I think perhaps I was.  I don't recall ever being here before, but everything I've seen, the city, you, the King himself, all seem ... like I've been here before, long ago.\""\nLady Jyllia gasped and took a step back.  She gripped the old woman, who had been looking out to sea and murmuring, by the hand.  The elderly creature looked to Jyllia, surprised, and then turned to Gyna.  Her ancient, half-blind eyes sparkled with recognition and she made a sound like a grunt of surprise.  Gyna also jumped.  If the King had seemed like something out of a half-forgotten dream, this woman was someone she knew.  As clear and yet indistinct as a guardian spirit.""},{""text"":""\""I apologize,\"" stammered Lady Jyllia. \""This is my childhood nursemaid, Ramke.\""""},{""text"":""\""It's her!\"" the old woman cried, wild-eyed.  She tried to run forward, arms outstretched, but Jyllia held her back.  Gyna felt strangely naked, and pulled her robe against her body.""},{""text"":""\""No, you're wrong,\"" Lady Jyllia whispered to Ramke, holding the old woman tightly. \""The Princess Talara is dead, you know that.  I shouldn't have brought you here.  I'll take you back home.\"" She turned back to Gyna, her eyes welling with tears. \""The entire royal family of Camlorn was assassinated over twenty years ago.  My father was Duke of Oloine, the King's brother, and so he inherited the crown.  I'm sorry to have bothered you.  Goodnight.\""""},{""text"":""Gyna gazed after Lady Jyllia and the old nurse as they disappeared into the crowd, but she had little time to consider all she had heard.  The sun was setting, and it was time for the Flower Festival.  Twelve young men emerged from the darkness wearing only loincloths and masks, and lit the torches.  The moment the fire blazed, Gyna and all the rest of the dancers rushed to the baskets, pulling out blossoms and vines by the handful.""},{""text"":""At first, the women danced with one another, sprinkling petals to the wind.  The crowd then joined in as the music swelled.  It was a mad, beautiful chaos.  Gyna leapt and swooned like a wild forest nymph.  Then, without warning, she felt rough hands grip her from behind and push her.""},{""text"":""She was falling before she understood it.  The moment the realization hit, she was closer to the bottom of the hundred foot tall cliff than she was to the top.  She flailed out her arms and grasped at the cliff wall.  Her fingers raked against the stone and her flesh tore, but she found a grip and held it.  For a moment, she stayed there, breathing hard.  Then she began to scream.""},{""text"":""The music and the festival were too loud up above: no one could hear her - she could scarcely hear herself.  Below her, the surf crashed.  Every bone in her body would snap if she fell.  She closed her eyes, and a vision came.  A man was standing below her, a King of great wisdom, great compassion, looking up, smiling.  A little girl, golden-haired, mischievous, her best friend and cousin, clung to the rock beside her.""},{""text"":""\""The secret to falling is making your body go limp.  And with luck, you won't get hurt,\"" the girl said.  She nodded, remembering who she was. Eight years of darkness lifted.""},{""text"":""She released her grip and let herself fall like a leaf into the water below.""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":""Mystery of Talara, part 2""},{""text"":""The Mystery of\nPrincess Talara\nPart II""},{""text"":""By\nMera Llykith""},{""text"":""\nShe felt nothing, darkness enveloping her body and mind.  Pain surged through her leg and with that sensation, a great feeling of cold washed over her.  She opened her eyes and saw that she was drowning.""},{""text"":""Her left leg would not move at all, but using her right one and her arms, she pulled herself up toward the moons above.  It was long way through the swirling currents that wrenched back at her.  At last she broke the surface and sucked in the cold night air.  She was still close to the rocky shoreline of the capitol city of the kingdom of Camlorn, but the water had carried her quite a ways from the point where she fell at Cavilstyr Rock.""},{""text"":""Not fell, she thought, correcting herself.  She had been pushed.""},{""text"":""Further down current, she allowed herself to drift.  There the steep cliff walls sloped lower until they were close to the water's edge.  The silhouette of a large house on the shore loomed ahead, and as she neared it, she could see smoke rising from the chimney and the flicker of firelight within.  The pain in her leg was great, but greater still was the chill of the water.  The thought of a warm hearth fire was all the motivation she needed to begin swimming again.""},{""text"":""At the shore's edge, she tried to stand but found she couldn't.  Her tears mixed with the sea water as she began to crawl across the sand and rock.  The simple white sheet which had been her costume at the Flower Festival was tattered and felt like a weight of lead across her back.  Beyond the point of exhaustion, she fell forward and began to sob.""},{""text"":""\""Please!\"" she cried. \""If you can hear me, please help!\""""},{""text"":""A moment later, the door to the house opened and a woman stepped out.  It was Ramke, the old lady she had met at the Flower Festival.  The one who had started and cried \""It's her!\"" even before she herself knew who she was.  By contrast, when the old woman came to her, this time there was no glimmer of recognition in her eyes.""},{""text"":""\""By Sethiete, are you hurt?\"" Ramke whispered, and helped her up, acting as her crutch. \""I've seen that gown before.  Were you one of the dancers at the Flower Festival tonight?  I was there with Lady Jyllia Raze, the daughter of the King.\""""},{""text"":""\""I know, she introduced us,\"" she groaned. \""I called myself Gyna of Daggerfall?\""""},{""text"":""\""Of course, I knew you looked familiar somehow,\"" the old woman chuckled, and led her hop by hop across the beach and into the front door. \""My memory isn't as good as it used to be.  Lets get you warm and have a look at that leg.\""""},{""text"":""Ramke took Gyna's soaking rags and covered her with a blanket as she sat at the fire.  As the numbness of the chill water began to leave her, it cruelly abandoned her to the intense agony of her leg.  Until then, she had not dared to look at it.  When she did, she felt vomit rise at the sight of the deep gash, fish-white dead flesh, plump and swollen.  Thick arterial blood bubbled up, splashing on the floor in streams.""},{""text"":""\""Oh dear,\"" said the old woman, returning to the fire. \""That must rather sting.  You're lucky that I still remember a little of the old healing spells.\""""},{""text"":""Ramke seated herself on the floor and pressed her hands on either side of the wound.  Gyna felt a flare of pain, and then a cool soft pinching and prickle.  When she looked down, Ramke was slowly sliding her wrinkled hands towards one another.  At their approach, the lesion began to mend before her eyes, flesh binding and bruises fading.""},{""text"":""\""Sweet Kynareth,\"" Gyna gasped. \""You've saved my life.\""""},{""text"":""\""Not only that, you won't have an ugly scar on your pretty leg,\"" Ramke chuckled. \""I had to use that spell so many times when Lady Jyllia was little.  You know, I was her nursemaid.\""""},{""text"":""\""I know,\"" Gyna smiled. \""But that was a long time ago, and you still remember the spell.\""""},{""text"":""\""Oh, when you're learning anything, even the School of Restoration, there's always a lot of study and mistakes, but once you're as old as I am, there's no longer any need to remember things.  You just know.  After all, I've probably cast it a thousand times before.  Little Lady Jyllia and the little Princess Talara was always getting cut and bruised.  Small wonder, the way they was always climbing all over the palace.\""""},{""text"":""Gyna sighed. \""You must have loved Lady Jyllia very much.\""""},{""text"":""\""I still do,\"" Ramke beamed. \""But now she's all grown and things are different.  You know, I didn't notice it before because you were all wet from the sea, but you look very much like my lady.  Did I mention that before when we met at the Festival?\""""},{""text"":""\""You did,\"" said Gyna. \""Or rather I think you thought I looked like Princess Talara.\""""},{""text"":""\""Oh, it would be so wonderful if you were the Princess returned,\"" the old woman gasped. \""You know, when the former royal family was killed, and everyone said the Princess was killed though we never found the body, I think the real victim was Lady Jyllia.

I found her afterwards, hiding in that terrible blood-stained throne room, and she was like a little broken doll.  She wouldn't speak, she wouldn't eat.  I tried all my healing spells, but it was quite beyond my power.  So much more than a scraped knee.  Her father who was then Duke of Oloine sent her to a sanitarium in the country to get well.\""""},{""text"":""\""That poor little girl,\"" cried Gyna.""},{""text"":""\""It took her years to be herself again,\"" said Ramke, nodding. \""And, in truth, she never really returned altogether.  You wonder why her father when he was made king didn't make her his heir?  He thought that she was still not exactly right, and in a way, as much as I would deny it, he's correct to think so.  She remembered nothing, nothing at all.\""""},{""text"":""\""Do you think,\"" Gyna considered her words carefully. \""That she would be better if she knew that her cousin the Princess Talara was alive and well?\""""},{""text"":""Ramke considered it. \""I think so.

Her gown had dried, and Ramke gave her a cloak, insisting she protect herself against the cold night air.  At the door, Gyna kissed the old woman's cheek and thanked her.  Not only for the healing spell and for the cloak, but for everything else of kindness she had ever done.""},{""text"":""The road close to the house went north and south.  To the left was the way back to Camlorn, where secrets lay to which she alone held the key.  To the south was Daggerfall, her home for more than twenty years.

Lord Eryl was too canny an actor to reveal it, but Gnorbooth knew at the pit of his stomach that the battlemage did not even know Lord Strale had left the capitol.  He had to get away to let the ambassador know, but there was still a game to be carefully played. \""He's not leaving for there until tomorrow.

It was harvest time in Umbington, and all of the field hands were drinking away their meager wages in the noisiest of fashions.  He was dressed appropriately for the venue, rough trousers and a simple peasant's vest, but he still felt conspicuous.  In comparison to his two female companions, he certainly was.  The woman to his right was used to frequenting the low places of Daggerfall as a common prostitute.  Lady Brisienna to his left was even more clearly in her element.""},{""text"":""\""By what name would you prefer I call you?\"" Lady Brisienna asked solicitously.""},{""text"":""\""I am used to the name Gyna, though that may have to change,\"" was her reply. \""Of course, it may not.

Perhaps that makes me the madwoman.\""""},{""text"":""\""Will you help us?\"" asked Lord Strale simply.""},{""text"":""\""It is a tricky business interfering in the affairs of the provincial kingdoms,\"" Lady Brisienna looked into the depths of her mug thoughtfully. \""Unless there is a threat to the Empire itself, we find it is best not to meddle.  What we have in your case is a very messy assassination that happened twenty years ago, and its aftermath.  If His Imperial Majesty involved itself in every bloody hiccup in the succession in each of his thousand vassal kingdoms, he would never accomplish anything for the greater good of Tamriel.\""""},{""text"":""\""I understand,\"" murmured Gyna. \""When I remembered everything, who I was and what happened to me, I resolved to do nothing about it.  In fact, I was leaving Camlorn and going back home to Daggerfall when I saw Lord Strale again.  He was the one who began this quest to resolve this, not me.  And when he brought me back, I only wanted to see my cousin to tell her who I was, but he forbade me.\""\n\""It would have been too dangerous,\"" growled Strale. \""We still don't know yet the depths of the conspiracy.  Perhaps we never will.\""""},{""text"":""\""I'm sorry, I always find myself giving long explanations to short questions.  When Lord Strale asked if I would help, I should have begun by saying 'yes,'\"" Lady Brisienna laughed at the change in Lord Strale and Gyna's expressions. \""I will help you, of course.

It was no secret that they were all prostitutes, and after the March and the Flower Festival that evening, they would be available for more intimate business.""},{""text1"":""Gyna attracted much of the attention with her tall, curvaceous figure barely covered by strips of silk and her curls of flaxen hair specked with flower petals.  In her late twenties, she wasn't the youngest of the prostitutes, but she was certainly one of the most desirable.  It was clear by her demeanor that she was used to the lascivious glances, though she was far from jaded at the sight of the city in splendor.  Compared to the squalid quarter of Daggerfall where she made her home, Camlorn at the height of celebration seemed so unreal.  And yet, what was even stranger was how, at the same time, familiar it all looked, though she had never been there before.""},{""text1"":""The King's daughter Lady Jyllia rode out of the palace gates, and immediately cursed her misfortune.  She had completely forgotten about the March of Beauty.  The streets were snarled, at a standstill.  It would take hours to wait for the March to pass, and she had promised her old nurse Ramke a visit in her house south of the city.  Jyllia thought for a moment, picturing in her mind the arrangement of streets in the city, and devised a shortcut to avoid the main street and the March.""},{""text1"":""For a few minutes she felt very clever as she wound her way through tight, curving side streets, but presently she came upon temporary structures, tents and theaters set up for the celebration, and had to improvise a new path.  In no time at all, she was lost in the city where she had lived all but five years of her life.""},{""text1"":""Peering down an alley, she saw the main avenue crowded with the March of Beauty.  Hoping that it was the tale end, and desirous not to be lost again, Lady Jyllia guided her horse toward the festival.  She did not see the snake-charmer at the mouth of the alley, and when his pet hissed and spread its hood, her charge reared up in fear.""},{""text1"":""The women in the parade gasped and surged back at the sight, but Lady Jyllia quickly calmed her stallion down.  She looked abashed at the spectacle she had caused.\n\""My apologies, ladies,\"" she said with a mock military salute.""},{""text1"":""\""It's all right, madam,\"" said a blonde in silk. \""We'll be out of your way in a moment.\""""},{""text1"":""Jyllia stared as the March passed her.  Looking at that whore had been like looking in a mirror.  The same age, and height, and hair, and eyes, and figure, almost exactly.  The woman looked back at her, and it seemed as if she was thinking the same thing.""},{""text1"":""And so Gyna was.  The old witches who sometimes came in to Daggerfall had sometimes spoke of doppelgangers, spirits that assumed the guise of their victims and portended certain death.  Yet the experience had not frightened her: it seemed only one more strangely familiar aspect of the alien city.  Before the March had danced it way into the palace gates, she had all but forgotten the encounter.""},{""text1"":""The prostitutes crushed into the courtyard, as the King himself came to the balcony to greet them.  At his side was his chief bodyguard, a battlemage by the look of him.  As for the King himself, he was a handsome man of middle age, rather unremarkable, but Gyna was awed at the sight of him.  A dream, perhaps.  Yes, that was it: she could see him as she had dreamt of him, high above her as he was now, bending now to kiss her.  Not a one of lust as she had experienced before, but one of small fondness, a dutiful kiss.""},{""text1"":""\""Dear ladies, you have filled the streets of the great capitol of Camlorn with your beauty,\"" cried the King, forcing a silence on the giggling, murmuring assembly.  He smiled proudly.  His eyes met Gyna's and he stopped, shaken.  For an eternity, they stayed locked together before His Highness recovered and continued his speech.""},{""text1"":""Afterwards, while the women were all en route back to their tents to change into their costumes for the evening, one of the older prostitutes approached Gyna: \""Did you see how the King looked at you?  If you're smart, you'll be the new royal mistress before this celebration ends.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I've seen looks of hunger before, and that wasn't one of them,\"" laughed Gyna. \""I'd wager he thought I was someone else, like that lady who tried to run us over with her horse.  She's probably his kin, and he thought she had dressed up like a courtesan and joined the March of Beauty.  Can you imagine the scandal?\""""},{""text1"":""When they arrived at the tents, they were greeted by a stocky, well-dressed young man with a bald pate and a commanding presence of authority.  He introduced himself as Lord Strale, ambassador to the Emperor himself, and their chief patron.  It was Strale who had hired them, on the Emperor's behalf, as a gift to the King and the kingdom of Camlorn.""},{""text1"":""\""The March of Beauty is but a precursor to the Flower Festival tonight,\"" he said.  Unlike the King, he did not have to yell to be heard.  His voice was loud and precise in its natural modulations. \""I expect each of you to perform well, and justify the significant expense I've suffered bringing you all the way up here.  Now hurry, you must be dressed and in position on Cavilstyr Rock before the sun goes down.\""""},{""text1"":""The ambassador needn't have worried.  The women were all professionals, experts at getting dressed and undressed with none of the time-consuming measures less promiscuous females required.  His manservant Gnorbooth offered his assistance, but found he had little to do.  Their costumes were simplicity itself: soft, narrow sheets with a hole for their heads.  Not even a belt was required, so the gowns were open at the sides exposing the frame of their skin.""},{""text1"":""So it was long before the sun had set that the prostitutes turned dancers were at Cavilstyr Rock.  It was a great, wide promontory facing the sea, and for the occasion of the Festival of Flowers, a large circle of unlit torches and covered baskets had been arranged.  As early as they were, a crowd of spectators had already arrived.  The women gathered in the center of the circle and waited until it was time.""},{""text1"":""Gyna watched the crowd as it grew, and was not surprised when she saw the lady from the March approaching, hand-in-hand with a very old, very short white-haired woman.  The old woman was distracted, pointing out islands out at sea.  The blonde lady seemed nervous, unsure of what to say.  Gyna was used to dealing with uneasy clients, and spoke first.""},{""text1"":""\""Good to see you again, madam.  I am Gyna of Daggerfall.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I'm glad you bear me no ill will because of the whores, I mean horse,\"" the lady laughed, somewhat relieved. \""I am Lady Jyllia Raze, daughter of the King.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I always thought that daughters of kings were called princess,\"" smiled Gyna.""},{""text1"":""\""In Camlorn, only when they are heirs to the throne.  I have a younger brother from my father's new wife whom he favors,\"" Jyllia replied.  She felt her head swim.  It was madness, speaking to a common prostitute, talking of family politics so intimately. \""Relative to that subject, I must ask you something very peculiar.  Have you ever heard of the Princess Talara?\""""},{""text1"":""Gyna thought a moment: \""The name sounds somewhat familiar.  Why would I have?\""""},{""text1"":""\""I don't know.  It was a name I just thought you might recognize,\"" sighed Lady Jyllia. \""Have you been to Camlorn before?\""""},{""text1"":""\""If I did, it was when I was very young,\"" said Gyna, and suddenly she felt it was her turn to be trusting.  Something about the Lady Jyllia's friendly and forthcoming manner touched her. \""To be honest, I don't remember anything at all of my childhood before I was nine or ten.  Perhaps I was here with my parents, whoever they were, when I was a little girl.  I tell you, I think perhaps I was.  I don't recall ever being here before, but everything I've seen, the city, you, the King himself, all seem ... like I've been here before, long ago.\""\nLady Jyllia gasped and took a step back.  She gripped the old woman, who had been looking out to sea and murmuring, by the hand.  The elderly creature looked to Jyllia, surprised, and then turned to Gyna.  Her ancient, half-blind eyes sparkled with recognition and she made a sound like a grunt of surprise.  Gyna also jumped.  If the King had seemed like something out of a half-forgotten dream, this woman was someone she knew.  As clear and yet indistinct as a guardian spirit.""},{""text1"":""\""I apologize,\"" stammered Lady Jyllia. \""This is my childhood nursemaid, Ramke.\""""},{""text1"":""\""It's her!\"" the old woman cried, wild-eyed.  She tried to run forward, arms outstretched, but Jyllia held her back.  Gyna felt strangely naked, and pulled her robe against her body.""},{""text1"":""\""No, you're wrong,\"" Lady Jyllia whispered to Ramke, holding the old woman tightly. \""The Princess Talara is dead, you know that.  I shouldn't have brought you here.  I'll take you back home.\"" She turned back to Gyna, her eyes welling with tears. \""The entire royal family of Camlorn was assassinated over twenty years ago.  My father was Duke of Oloine, the King's brother, and so he inherited the crown.  I'm sorry to have bothered you.  Goodnight.\""""},{""text1"":""Gyna gazed after Lady Jyllia and the old nurse as they disappeared into the crowd, but she had little time to consider all she had heard.  The sun was setting, and it was time for the Flower Festival.  Twelve young men emerged from the darkness wearing only loincloths and masks, and lit the torches.  The moment the fire blazed, Gyna and all the rest of the dancers rushed to the baskets, pulling out blossoms and vines by the handful.""},{""text1"":""At first, the women danced with one another, sprinkling petals to the wind.  The crowd then joined in as the music swelled.  It was a mad, beautiful chaos.  Gyna leapt and swooned like a wild forest nymph.  Then, without warning, she felt rough hands grip her from behind and push her.""},{""text1"":""She was falling before she understood it.  The moment the realization hit, she was closer to the bottom of the hundred foot tall cliff than she was to the top.  She flailed out her arms and grasped at the cliff wall.  Her fingers raked against the stone and her flesh tore, but she found a grip and held it.  For a moment, she stayed there, breathing hard.  Then she began to scream.""},{""text1"":""The music and the festival were too loud up above: no one could hear her - she could scarcely hear herself.  Below her, the surf crashed.  Every bone in her body would snap if she fell.  She closed her eyes, and a vision came.  A man was standing below her, a King of great wisdom, great compassion, looking up, smiling.  A little girl, golden-haired, mischievous, her best friend and cousin, clung to the rock beside her.""},{""text1"":""\""The secret to falling is making your body go limp.  And with luck, you won't get hurt,\"" the girl said.  She nodded, remembering who she was. Eight years of darkness lifted.""},{""text1"":""She released her grip and let herself fall like a leaf into the water below.""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""The Mystery of\nPrincess Talara\nPart II""},{""text1"":""By\nMera Llykith""},{""text1"":""\nShe felt nothing, darkness enveloping her body and mind.  Pain surged through her leg and with that sensation, a great feeling of cold washed over her.  She opened her eyes and saw that she was drowning.""},{""text1"":""Her left leg would not move at all, but using her right one and her arms, she pulled herself up toward the moons above.  It was long way through the swirling currents that wrenched back at her.  At last she broke the surface and sucked in the cold night air.  She was still close to the rocky shoreline of the capitol city of the kingdom of Camlorn, but the water had carried her quite a ways from the point where she fell at Cavilstyr Rock.""},{""text1"":""Not fell, she thought, correcting herself.  She had been pushed.""},{""text1"":""Further down current, she allowed herself to drift.  There the steep cliff walls sloped lower until they were close to the water's edge.  The silhouette of a large house on the shore loomed ahead, and as she neared it, she could see smoke rising from the chimney and the flicker of firelight within.  The pain in her leg was great, but greater still was the chill of the water.  The thought of a warm hearth fire was all the motivation she needed to begin swimming again.""},{""text1"":""At the shore's edge, she tried to stand but found she couldn't.  Her tears mixed with the sea water as she began to crawl across the sand and rock.  The simple white sheet which had been her costume at the Flower Festival was tattered and felt like a weight of lead across her back.  Beyond the point of exhaustion, she fell forward and began to sob.""},{""text1"":""\""Please!\"" she cried. \""If you can hear me, please help!\""""},{""text1"":""A moment later, the door to the house opened and a woman stepped out.  It was Ramke, the old lady she had met at the Flower Festival.  The one who had started and cried \""It's her!\"" even before she herself knew who she was.  By contrast, when the old woman came to her, this time there was no glimmer of recognition in her eyes.""},{""text1"":""\""By Sethiete, are you hurt?\"" Ramke whispered, and helped her up, acting as her crutch. \""I've seen that gown before.  Were you one of the dancers at the Flower Festival tonight?  I was there with Lady Jyllia Raze, the daughter of the King.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I know, she introduced us,\"" she groaned. \""I called myself Gyna of Daggerfall?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Of course, I knew you looked familiar somehow,\"" the old woman chuckled, and led her hop by hop across the beach and into the front door. \""My memory isn't as good as it used to be.  Lets get you warm and have a look at that leg.\""""},{""text1"":""Ramke took Gyna's soaking rags and covered her with a blanket as she sat at the fire.  As the numbness of the chill water began to leave her, it cruelly abandoned her to the intense agony of her leg.  Until then, she had not dared to look at it.  When she did, she felt vomit rise at the sight of the deep gash, fish-white dead flesh, plump and swollen.  Thick arterial blood bubbled up, splashing on the floor in streams.""},{""text1"":""\""Oh dear,\"" said the old woman, returning to the fire. \""That must rather sting.  You're lucky that I still remember a little of the old healing spells.\""""},{""text1"":""Ramke seated herself on the floor and pressed her hands on either side of the wound.  Gyna felt a flare of pain, and then a cool soft pinching and prickle.  When she looked down, Ramke was slowly sliding her wrinkled hands towards one another.  At their approach, the lesion began to mend before her eyes, flesh binding and bruises fading.""},{""text1"":""\""Sweet Kynareth,\"" Gyna gasped. \""You've saved my life.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Not only that, you won't have an ugly scar on your pretty leg,\"" Ramke chuckled. \""I had to use that spell so many times when Lady Jyllia was little.  You know, I was her nursemaid.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I know,\"" Gyna smiled. \""But that was a long time ago, and you still remember the spell.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Oh, when you're learning anything, even the School of Restoration, there's always a lot of study and mistakes, but once you're as old as I am, there's no longer any need to remember things.  You just know.  After all, I've probably cast it a thousand times before.  Little Lady Jyllia and the little Princess Talara was always getting cut and bruised.  Small wonder, the way they was always climbing all over the palace.\""""},{""text1"":""Gyna sighed. \""You must have loved Lady Jyllia very much.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I still do,\"" Ramke beamed. \""But now she's all grown and things are different.  You know, I didn't notice it before because you were all wet from the sea, but you look very much like my lady.  Did I mention that before when we met at the Festival?\""""},{""text1"":""\""You did,\"" said Gyna. \""Or rather I think you thought I looked like Princess Talara.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Oh, it would be so wonderful if you were the Princess returned,\"" the old woman gasped. \""You know, when the former royal family was killed, and everyone said the Princess was killed though we never found the body, I think the real victim was Lady Jyllia.  Her little heart just broke, and for a while, it looked like her mind did too.\""""},{""text1"":""\""What do you mean?\"" asked Gyna. \""What happened?\""""},{""text1"":""\""I don't know if I should tell a stranger this, but it's fairly well-known in Camlorn, and I really feel like I know you,\"" Ramke struggled with her conscience and then released. \""Jyllia saw the assassination, you see.  I found her afterwards, hiding in that terrible blood-stained throne room, and she was like a little broken doll.  She wouldn't speak, she wouldn't eat.  I tried all my healing spells, but it was quite beyond my power.  So much more than a scraped knee.  Her father who was then Duke of Oloine sent her to a sanitarium in the country to get well.\""""},{""text1"":""\""That poor little girl,\"" cried Gyna.""},{""text1"":""\""It took her years to be herself again,\"" said Ramke, nodding. \""And, in truth, she never really returned altogether.  You wonder why her father when he was made king didn't make her his heir?  He thought that she was still not exactly right, and in a way, as much as I would deny it, he's correct to think so.  She remembered nothing, nothing at all.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Do you think,\"" Gyna considered her words carefully. \""That she would be better if she knew that her cousin the Princess Talara was alive and well?\""""},{""text1"":""Ramke considered it. \""I think so.  But maybe not.  Sometimes it's best not to hope.\""""},{""text1"":""Gyna stood up, finding her leg to be as strong as it looked to be.  Her gown had dried, and Ramke gave her a cloak, insisting she protect herself against the cold night air.  At the door, Gyna kissed the old woman's cheek and thanked her.  Not only for the healing spell and for the cloak, but for everything else of kindness she had ever done.""},{""text1"":""The road close to the house went north and south.  To the left was the way back to Camlorn, where secrets lay to which she alone held the key.  To the south was Daggerfall, her home for more than twenty years.  She could return there, back to her profession on the streets, very easily.  For a few seconds, she considered her options, and then made her choice.""},{""text1"":""She had not been walking for very long, when a black carriage drawn by three horses bearing the Imperial Seal, together with eight mounted horses, passed her.  Before it rounded the wooded pass ahead, it stopped suddenly.  She recognized one of the soldiers as Gnorbooth, Lord Strale's manservant.  The door opened and Lord Strale himself, the Emperor's ambassador, the man who had hired her and all the other women to entertain at court, stepped out.""},{""text1"":""\""You!' he frowned. \""You're one of the prostitutes, aren't you?  You're the one who disappeared during the Flower Festival?  Gyna, am I right?\""""},{""text1"":""\""All that is true,\"" she smiled sourly. \""Except my name I've discovered is not Gyna.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I don't care what it is,\"" said Lord Strale. \""What are you doing on the south road?  I paid for you to stay and make the kingdom merry.\""""},{""text1"":""\""If I went back to Camlorn, there are a great many who wouldn't be merry at all.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Explain yourself,\"" said Lord Strale.""},{""text1"":""So she did.  And he listened.""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""The Mystery \nof\nPrincess Talara\nPart III""},{""text1"":""By\nMera Llykith""},{""text1"":""\nGnorbooth was leaving his favorite pub in Camlorn, The Breaking Branch, when he heard someone calling his name.  His was not the sort of a name that could be mistaken for another.  He turned and saw Lord Eryl, the Royal Battlemage from the palace, emerge from the darkness of the alley.""},{""text1"":""\""Milord,\"" said Gnorbooth with a pleasant smile.""},{""text1"":""\""I'm surprised to see you out this evening, Gnorbooth,\"" grinned Lord Eryl with a most unpleasant smile. \""I have not seen you and your master very much since the millennial celebration, but I understand you've been very busy.  What I've been wondering is what you've been busy doing.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Protecting the Imperial interests in Camlorn is busy work, milord.  But I cannot imagine you would be interested in the minutiae of the ambassador's appointments.\""""},{""text1"":""\""But I am,\"" said the battlemage. \""Especially as the ambassador has begun acting most mysteriously, most undiplomatically lately.  And I understand that he has taken one of the whores from the Flower Festival into his house.  I believe her name is Gyna?\""""},{""text1"":""Gnorbooth shrugged: \""He's in love, I would imagine, milord.  It can make men act very strangely, as I'm sure you've heard before.\""""},{""text1"":""\""She is a most comely wench,\"" laughed Lord Eryl. \""Have you noticed how much she resembles the late Princess Talara?\""""},{""text1"":""\""I have only been in Camlorn for fifteen years, milord.  I never saw her late majesty.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Now I could understand it if he had taken to writing poetry, but what man in love spends his days in the kitchens of the palace, talking to old servants?  That hardly sounds like molten passion to me, even based on my limited experience.\"" Lord Eryl rolled his eyes. \""And what is this business he has now in - oh, what is the name of that village?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Umbington?\"" replied Gnorbooth, and immediately wished he hadn't.  Lord Eryl was too canny an actor to reveal it, but Gnorbooth knew at the pit of his stomach that the battlemage did not even know Lord Strale had left the capitol.  He had to get away to let the ambassador know, but there was still a game to be carefully played. \""He's not leaving for there until tomorrow.  I believe it's just to put a stamp on some deed that needs the Imperial seal.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Is that all?  How tedious for the poor fellow.  I suppose I'll see him when he returns then,\"" Lord Eryl bowed. \""Thank you for being so informative.  Farewell.\""""},{""text1"":""The moment the royal battlemage turned the corner, Gnorbooth leapt onto his horse.  He had drunk one or two ales too many, but he knew he must find his way to Umbington before Lord Eryl's agents did.  He galloped east out of the capitol, hoping there were signs along the road.""},{""text1"":""Seated in a tavern that smelled of mildew and sour beer, Lord Strale marveled at how the Emperor's agent Lady Brisienna always found the most public of places for her most private of conferences.  It was harvest time in Umbington, and all of the field hands were drinking away their meager wages in the noisiest of fashions.  He was dressed appropriately for the venue, rough trousers and a simple peasant's vest, but he still felt conspicuous.  In comparison to his two female companions, he certainly was.  The woman to his right was used to frequenting the low places of Daggerfall as a common prostitute.  Lady Brisienna to his left was even more clearly in her element.""},{""text1"":""\""By what name would you prefer I call you?\"" Lady Brisienna asked solicitously.""},{""text1"":""\""I am used to the name Gyna, though that may have to change,\"" was her reply. \""Of course, it may not.

The only permanent solution is to capture those who would do you harm and then to raise you to your proper station.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Do you believe my story?\"" Gyna turned to Lady Brisienna.""},{""text1"":""\""I have been the Emperor's chief agent in High Rock for many years now, and I have heard few stranger tales.  If your friend the ambassador hadn't investigated and discovered what he has, I would have dismissed you outright as a madwoman,\"" Brisienna laughed, forcing a smile onto Gyna's face to match. \""But now, yes, I do believe you.  Perhaps that makes me the madwoman.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Will you help us?\"" asked Lord Strale simply.""},{""text1"":""\""It is a tricky business interfering in the affairs of the provincial kingdoms,\"" Lady Brisienna looked into the depths of her mug thoughtfully. \""Unless there is a threat to the Empire itself, we find it is best not to meddle.  What we have in your case is a very messy assassination that happened twenty years ago, and its aftermath.  If His Imperial Majesty involved itself in every bloody hiccup in the succession in each of his thousand vassal kingdoms, he would never accomplish anything for the greater good of Tamriel.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I understand,\"" murmured Gyna. \""When I remembered everything, who I was and what happened to me, I resolved to do nothing about it.  In fact, I was leaving Camlorn and going back home to Daggerfall when I saw Lord Strale again.  He was the one who began this quest to resolve this, not me.  And when he brought me back, I only wanted to see my cousin to tell her who I was, but he forbade me.\""\n\""It would have been too dangerous,\"" growled Strale. \""We still don't know yet the depths of the conspiracy.  Perhaps we never will.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I'm sorry, I always find myself giving long explanations to short questions.  When Lord Strale asked if I would help, I should have begun by saying 'yes,'\"" Lady Brisienna laughed at the change in Lord Strale and Gyna's expressions. \""I will help you, of course.  But for this to turn out well, you must accomplish two things to the Emperor's satisfaction.  First, you must prove with absolute certainty who is the power behind this plot you've uncovered.  You must get someone to confess.\""""},{""text1"":""\""And secondly,\"" said Lord Strale, nodding. \""We must prove that this is a matter worthy of His Imperial Majesty's consideration, and not merely a minor local concern.\""""},{""text1"":""Lord Strale, Lady Brisienna, and the woman who called herself Gyna discussed how to accomplish their goals for a few hours more.  When it was agreed what had to be done, Lady Brisienna took her leave to find her ally Proseccus.  Strale and Gyna set off to the west, toward Camlorn.  It was not long after beginning their ride through the woods that they heard the sound of galloping hoof beats far up ahead.  Lord Strale unsheathed his sword and signaled for Gyna to position her horse behind him.""},{""text1"":""At that moment, they were attacked on all sides.  It was an ambush. Eight men, armed with axes, had been lying in wait.""},{""text1"":""Lord Strale quickly yanked Gyna from her horse, pulling her behind him.  He made a brief, deft motion with his hands.  A ring of flame materialized around them, and rushed outward, striking their assailants.  The men roared in pain and dropped to their knees.  Lord Strale jumped the horse over the closest one, and galloped at full speed westward.""},{""text1"":""\""I thought you were an ambassador not a mage!\"" laughed Gyna.""},{""text1"":""\""I still believe there are times for diplomacy,\"" replied Lord Strale.""},{""text1"":""The horse and rider they had heard before met them on the road.  It was Gnorbooth. \""Milord, it's the royal battlemage!  He found out you two were in Umbington!\""""},{""text1"":""\""With considerable ease, I might add,\"" Lord Eryl's voice boomed out of the woods.  Gnorbooth, Gyna, and Lord Strale scanned the dark trees, but they showed nothing.  The battlemage's voice seemed to emanate from everywhere and nowhere.""},{""text1"":""\""I'm sorry, milord,\"" groaned Gnorbooth. \""I tried to warn you as soon as I could.\""""},{""text1"":""\""In your next life, perhaps you'll remember not to trust your plans to a drunkard!\"" laughed Lord Eryl.  He had them in his sight, and the spell was unleashed.""},{""text1"":""Gnorbooth saw him first, by the light of the ball of fire that leapt from his fingertips.  Later, Lord Eryl was to wonder to himself what the fool had intended to do.  Perhaps he was rushing forward to pull Lord Strale out of the path.  Perhaps he was trying to flee the path of destruction, and had simply moved left when he should have moved right.  Perhaps, as unlikely as it seemed, he was willing to sacrifice himself to save his master.  Whatever the reason, the result was the same.""},{""text1"":""He got in the way.""},{""text1"":""There was an explosion of energy that filled the night, and an echoing boom that shook birds from the trees for a mile around. On the few square feet where Gnorbooth and his horse had stood was nothing but black glass.  They had been reduced to less than vapor.  Gyna and Lord Strale were thrown back.  Their horse, when it recovered its senses, galloped away as fast as it could.  In the lingering glowing aura of the spell's detonation, Lord Strale looked straight into the woods and into the wide eyes of the battlemage.""},{""text1"":""\""Damn,\"" said Lord Eryl and began to run.  The ambassador jumped to his feet and pursued.""},{""text1"":""\""That was an expensive use of magicka, even for you,\"" said Lord Strale as he ran. \""Don't you know well enough not to use ranged spells unless you are certain your target won't be blocked?\""""},{""text1"":""\""I never thought - that idiot -\"" Lord Eryl was struck from behind and knocked to the wet forest floor before he had a chance to finish his lamentation.""},{""text1"":""\""It doesn't matter what you thought,\"" said Lord Strale calmly, flipping the battlemage around and pinning his arms to the ground with his knees. \""I'm not a battlemage, but I knew enough not to use my entire reserve on your little ambush.

So I talked to everyone who was here at the palace twenty years ago to see if there could be any truth to it.  Of course, at the time of the King and Queen's murder, and the Princess's disappearance, there was a full inquiry made, but I had different questions to ask this time.  Questions about the relationship between the two little cousins, Lady Jyllia Raze and the Princess.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I've told everyone over and over again, I don't remember anything at all about that time in my life,\"" said Jyllia, tears welling up.""},{""text1"":""\""I know you don't.  There has never been a question in my mind that you witnessed a horrible murder, and that your memory lapse and hers,\"" said Lord Strale, gesturing toward Gyna \""Are both very real. The story I heard from the servants and other people at the palace was that the little girls were inseparably close.  There were no other playmates, and as the Princess's place was to be close to her parents, so the little Lady Jyllia was always there as well.  When the assassin came to murder the Royal Family, the King and Queen were in their bedroom, and the girls were playing in the throne room.\""""},{""text1"":""\""When my memory came back to me, it was like opening a sealed box,\"" said Gyna solemnly. \""Everything was so clear and detailed, like it all happened yesterday not twenty years ago.  I was on the throne, playing Empress, and you were hiding behind the dais, pretending you were in a dungeon I had sent you to.  A man I had never seen burst into the room from the Royal bedchamber, his blade soaked in blood.  He came at me, and I ran for my life.  I remember starting to run for the dais, but I saw your face, frozen in fear, and I didn't want to lead him to you.  So I ran for the window.""},{""text1"":""\""We had climbed on the outside of the castle before, just for fun, that was one of the first memories that came back to me when I was holding onto that cliff.  You and I on the castle wall, and the King calling up to me, telling me how to get down.  But that day, I couldn't hold on, I was trembling so much.  I just fell, and landed in the river.""},{""text1"":""\""I don't know if it was entirely the horror of what I had seen, or that combined with the impact of the fall and the coldness of the water, but everything just went blank in my mind.  When I finally pulled myself out of the river, many miles away, I had no idea who I was.  And so it stayed,\"" Gyna smiled. \""Until now.\""""},{""text1"":""\""So you are the Princess Talara?\"" cried Jyllia.""},{""text1"":""\""Let me explain further before she answers that, because the simple answer would just confuse you, as it did me,\"" said Lord Strale. \""The assassin was caught before he managed to escape the palace - in truth, he had to know he was going to be caught.  He confessed immediately to the murders of the Royal Family.  The Princess, he said, he had thrown out the window to her death.  A servant down below heard the scream, and saw something fly past his window, so he knew it to be true.""},{""text1"":""\""It was not for several hours that little Lady Jyllia was found by her nursemaid Ramke hiding behind the dais, coated with dust, shivering with fear, and unable to speak at all.  Ramke was very protective of you,\"" Strale said, nodding to Jyllia. \""She insisted on putting you to your room right away, and sent word the Duke of Oloine that the Royal Family was dead, and that his daughter had witnessed the murders but survived.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I'm beginning to remember a little of that,\"" said Jyllia, wonderingly. \""I remember lying in bed, with Ramke comforting me.  I was so muddled and I couldn't concentrate.  I remember I just wanted it all to be play time still, I don't know why.  And then, I remember being bundled up and taken to that asylum.\""""},{""text1"":""\""It'll all come back to you soon,\"" Gyna smiled. \""I promise.  That's how I began to remember.  I just caught one detail, and the whole flood began.\""""},{""text1"":""\""That's it,\"" Jyllia began to sob in frustration. \""I don't remember anything else except confusion.  No, I also remember Daddy not even looking at me as I was taken away.  And I remember not caring about that, or anything else.\""""},{""text1"":""\""It was a confusing time for all, so particularly so for little girls.  Especially little girls who went through what you two did,\"" said Lord Strale sympathetically. \""From what I understand, as soon as he received the message from Ramke, the Duke left his palace at Oloine, gave orders for you to be sent to a private sanitarium until you'd recovered from your ordeal, and set to work with his private guard torturing the assassin for information.  When I heard that, that no one but the Duke and his personal guard saw the assassin after he gave his initial confession, and that no one was present but the Duke and his guards when the assassin was killed trying to escape, I thought that very significant.""},{""text1"":""\""I spoke with Lord Eryl, who I knew was one of those present, and I had to bluff him, pretending I had more evidence than I did.  I got the reaction I was hoping for, though it was a dangerous gambit.  At last he confessed to what I already knew to be true.""},{""text1"":""\""The assassin,\"" Lord Strale paused, and reluctantly met Jyllia's eyes, \""Had been hired by the Duke of Oloine to kill the Royal Family, including the Princess as heir, so that the crown might be passed to him and to his children.\""""},{""text1"":""Jyllia stared at Lord Strale, aghast. \""My father -\""""},{""text1"":""\""The assassin had been told that once the Duke had him in custody, he would be paid and a prison break would be arranged.  The thug picked the wrong time to be greedy and try to get more gold.  The Duke decided that it would be cheaper to silence him, so he murdered him then and there, so the man would never tell anyone what really happened,\"" Lord Strale shrugged. \""No tragic loss as far as murders go.  In a few years' time, you returned from the sanitarium, a little shaken but back to normal, except for a complete absence of memory about your childhood.  And in that time, the former Duke of Oloine had taken his brother's place as the King of Camlorn. It was no small maneuver.\""""},{""text1"":""\""No,\"" said Jyllia, quietly. \""He must have been very busy.  He remarried and had another child.  No one ever came to visit me in the sanitarium but Ramke.\""""},{""text1"":""\""If he had visited and seen you,\"" said Gyna. \""This story might have turned out very differently.\""""},{""text1"":""\""What do you mean?\"" asked Jyllia.""},{""text1"":""\""This is the most amazing part,\"" said Lord Strale. \""The question has long been whether Gyna is the Princess Talara.  When her memory returned, and she told me what she remembered, I put several pieces of evidence together.  Consider these facts.""},{""text1"":""\""The two of you look remarkably alike now after twenty years of living very different lives, and as little girls and constant playmates, you looked nearly identical.""},{""text1"":""\""At the time of the assassination, the murderer who had never been there before, only saw one girl on the throne, who he assumed to be his quarry.""},{""text1"":""\""The woman who found Lady Jyllia was her nursemaid Ramke, a creature of unstable mind and fanatical devotion to her charge - the type would never accept the possibility that her beloved little girl had been the one who disappeared.  The nursemaid was the only single person who knew both Princess Talara and the Lady Jyllia who visited you while you were in the sanitarium.""},{""text1"":""\""Finally,\"" said Lord Strale, \""Consider the fact that when you returned to court from the sanitarium, five years had past, and you had grown from a child to a young lady.  You looked familiar, but not quite the same as your family remembered you, which is only natural.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I don't understand,\"" cried the poor girl, her eyes wide, because she did understand.  Here memory was falling together like a terrible flood.""},{""text1"":""\""Let me explain it like this,\"" said her cousin, wrapping her in her arms. \""I know who I am now.  My real name is Jyllia Raze.  That man who was arrested was my father, the man who murdered the King - your father.  YOU are the Princess Talara.\""""},{""text1"":"" ""}]"

His four factories located throughout Elsweyr make reproductions of his work, but his original tapestries command stellar prices.  The Emperor himself owns ten Cherim tapestries, and his representatives are currently negotiating the sale of five more.""},{""text1"":""The muted use of color contrasted with the luminous skin tones of Cherim's subjects is a marked contrast with the old style of tapestry.  The subjects of his work in recent years have been fabulous tales of the ancient past: the Gods meeting to discuss the formation of the world; the Chimer following the Prophet Veloth into Morrowind;  the Wild Elves battling Morihaus and his legions at the White Gold Tower.  His earliest designs dealt with more contemporary subjects.  I had the opportunity to discuss with him one of his first masterpieces, The Heart of Anequina, at his villa in Orcrest.""},{""text1"":""The Heart of Anequina presents an historic battle of the Five Year War between Elsweyr and Valenwood which raged from 3E 394 (or 3E 395, depending on what one considers to be the beginning of the war) until 3E 399.  In most fair accounts, the war lasted 4 years and 9 months, but artistic license from the great epic poets added an additional three months to the ordeal.""},{""text1"":""The actual details of the battle itself, as interpreted by Cherim, are explicit.  The faces of a hundred and twenty Wood Elf archers can be differentiated one from the other, each registering fear at the approach of the Khajiti army.  Their hauberks catch the dim light of the sun.  The menacing shadows of the Elsweyr battlecats loom on the hills, every muscle strained, ready to pounce in command.  It is not surprising that he got all the details right, because Cherim was in the midst of it, as a Khajiti foot soldier.""},{""text1"":""Every minute part of the Khajiti traditional armor can be seen in the soldiers in the foreground.  The embroidered edging and striped patterns on the tunics.  Each lacquered plate on loose-fitting leather in the Elsweyr style.

Cherim wore it at the insistence of our Nord advisors during the Battle of Zelinin, and Cherim couldn't even turn to see what my fellow Khajiit were doing.  Cherim did some sketches for a tapestry of the Battle of Zelinin, but Cherim finds that to make it realistic, the figures came out very mechanical, like iron golems or dwemer centurions.  Knowing our Khajiti commanders, Cherim would not be surprised if giving up the heavy plate was more aesthetic than practical.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Elsweyr lost the Battle of Zelinin, didn't she?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Yes, but Elsweyr won the war, starting at the next battle, the Heart of Anequina,\"" said Cherim with a smile. \""The tide turned as soon as we Khajiit sent our Nordic advisors back to Solitude.  We had to get rid of all the heavy armor they brought to us and find enough traditional armor our troops felt comfortable wearing. Obviously, the principle advantage of the traditional armor was that we could move easily in it, as you can see from the natural stances of the soldiers in the tapestry.""},{""text1"":""\""Now if you look at this poor perforated Cathay-raht who just keeps battling on in the bottom background, you see the other advantage.  It seems strange to say, but one of the best features of traditional armor is that an arrow will either deflect completely or pass all the way through. An arrow head is like a hook, made to stick where it strikes if it doesn't pass through.  A soldier in traditional armor will find himself with a hole in his body and the bolt on the other side. Our healers can fix such a wound easily if it isn't fatal, but if the arrow still remains in the armor, as it does with heavier armor, the wound will be reopened every time the fellow moves. Unless the Khajiit strips off the armor and pulls out the arrow, which is what we had to do at the Battle of Zelinin. A difficult and time-consuming process in the heat of battle, to say the least.\""""},{""text1"":""I asked him next, \""Is there a self portrait in the battle?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Yes,\"" Cherim said with another grin. \""You see the small figure of the Khajiit stealing the rings off the dead Wood Elf?  His back is facing you, but he has a brown and orange striped tail like Cherim's. Cherim does not say that all stereotypes about the Khajiit are fair, but Cherim must sometimes acknowledge them.\""""},{""text1"":""A self-deprecating style in self-portraiture is also evident in the tapestries of Ranulf Hook, the next artist interviewed in volume nineteen of this series.""}]"

Thus, members of House Hlaalu may be referred to collectively as Yellows.""},{""text1"":""\tThe Great Houses traditions derive from ancient Dunmer clan and tribes, but now function as political parties. Dunmer Great House membership is largely a matter of birth and marriage, but Imperial colonists may also become retainers of a Great House, or may be adopted into a Great House. Initially an outlander may gain status in a house as an oath-bonded hireling, pledging exclusive loyalty to a single house and forsaking ambitions with all other houses. Later, after faithful service and advancement in lower ranks, an outlander may seek adoption into a Great House. Adoption and advancement to higher ranks in a Great House requires that a Great House councilor stand as sponsor for the candidate's character and loyalty. Finding a councilor to sponsor an outlander often involves performing a great service for the prospective sponsor.""},{""text1"":""\tHouse Redoran is one of the three Dunmer Great Houses with holdings on Vvardenfell.

Life is hard, and events must be judged, endured, and reflected upon with due care and earnestness. Piety is respect for the gods, and the virtues they represent. A light, careless life is not worth living. Redoran settlements are designed in the Dunmer village style, built of local materials, with organic curves and undecorated exteriors inspired by the landscape and by the shells of giant native insects. Redoran villages are typically centered on Temple compounds and their courtyards, with huts and tradehouses gathered around a central plaza, as in the West Gash village of Gnisis. Ald'ruhn, the Redoran district seat, is exceptional, with its distinctive feature being the colossal prehistoric bug shell that has been adapted as the house's council house.""},{""text1"":""\tAs a result of its close relationship with the Imperial administration, House Hlaalu has emerged as politically and economically dominant among the Great Houses of Vvardenfell and Morrowind. Hlaalu welcomes Imperial culture and law, Imperial Legions and bureaucracy, and Imperial freedom of trade and religion. Hlaalu still honors the old Dunmer ways -- the ancestors, the Temple, and the noble houses -- but has readily adapted to the rapid pace of change and progress in the Imperial provinces. Unlike the other Great Houses, which are largely hostile to non-Dunmer, House Hlaalu aspires to live in peace and harmony with the other races, and to share in the growth and prosperity of the Empire. Hlaalu public buildings -- tradehouses and craft guilds, manors and council halls -- are designed as simple multi-storied buildings roughly rectangular in plan, featuring arched entranceways and modest decorated exteriors. More modest one-story private dwellings follow the same plan, except with less decoration. Hlaalu plantation estates resemble Temple compounds, with walled precincts enclosing outbuildings for craftsmen and servants, dominated by a grand manor residence in place of a Temple shrine.""},{""text1"":""\tThe wizard-lords of House Telvanni have traditionally isolated themselves, pursuing wisdom and mastery in solitude. But certain ambitious wizards-lords, their retainers, and clients have entered whole-heartedly into the competition to control and exploit Vvardenfell's land and resources, building towers and bases all along the eastern coast. According to Telvanni principles, the powerful define the standards of virtue, and the Telvanni are unwilling to allow the ambitious Hlaalu to dominate Vvardenfell's untapped resources by default. Telvanni architecture is dominated by the wizards' tower, a fantastic organic form grown and sculpted from stems, caps, and root-like holdfasts of the giant native mushrooms. Telvanni villages are comprised of smaller mushroom pods hollowed out for craftsmen and commoners. Open-air markets often include the giant cages displaying the wares of the slave masters.""},{""text1"":""\tHouse Indoril and House Dres are the two Great Houses without holdings or interest in Vvardenfell.

House Indoril is openly hostile to Imperial culture and religion, and preserves many traditional Dunmer customs and practices in defiance of Imperial law. Dres District is in the south of Morrowind, bordering the swamps and marshes of Black Marsh. House Dres is an agrarian agricultural society, and its large saltrice plantations rely completely on slave labor for their economic viability. Always firm Temple supporters, House Dres is hostile to Imperial law and culture, and in particular opposed to any attempts to limit the institution of slavery.""}]"

They sought to live life as their ancestors had in Skyrim -- free to kill what they wanted when they wanted, free to worship in any manner they chose.""},{""text1"":""The group braved the harsh weather and traveled south toward Lake Fjalding, where they found the perfect location for a new settlement. There they decided to construct a grand mead hall that would serve as their new home and hunting lodge. After several months of building, the companions had completed the task, and named the mead hall Thirsk.""},{""text1"":""The settlers looked upon all they had accomplished, and were truly proud of their accomplishment. But their happiness was short lived, and the settlers soon learned that not everyone celebrated the construction of Thirsk. As the mead hall was being erected, so too was the noise and commotion of construction disturbing an ancient creature that lie dormant under the ice. It was a tragic twist of irony, therefore, that as the last beam of the great hall was nailed in place, the slumbering beast did finally awaken. His ancient name was the Udyrfrykte, though the settlers knew him only as death. The Udyrfrykte came to the newly completed mead hall and wreaked vengeance upon those who had shattered the peace of his long, cold sleep. He killed without warning, without mercy, reducing the Thirsk Nords to half their number. It was the valiant sorcerer Eldrid Ice-Light who finally drove the beast back to his lair beneath the frozen lake, and used his magicka to seal the entrance with a great wall of ice. The horror was over, but the price was great. It took the settlers two months to fix the damage done by the Udyrfrykte, and with so many strong hands now gone, it was slow and tedious work.""},{""text1"":""Finally, Thirsk stood tall and proud once more. But even though the settlers had worked together to construct the mead hall and drive away the threat of the Udyrfrykte, tensions quickly grew over who would serve as their leader. Most of the men considered Hrothmund the Red their de facto chieftain, as he was the strongest and most capable of the lot. But one warrior, Drengr Bronze-Helm, disagreed. He thought himself most capable to rule over Thirsk, and loudly voiced his opposition to Hrothmund. Knowing that conflict and discord would only serve to destroy the new life they had worked so hard to create, Hrothmund the Red exercised his only true option - he swung his great axe and beheaded Drengr Bronze-Helm where he stood. The Nords appreciated more than anything a warrior's prowess in battle, and Drengr's slaying proved to them that Hrothmund was indeed most worthy to be Thirsk's chieftain. So that the other Nords would never forget he had proven his right to lead, Hrothmund placed Drengr's head on a pedestal in the center of Thirsk's main hall, for all to see.""},{""text1"":""And so began Thirsk's most time-honored tradition. Any warrior, regardless of race or sex, could claim leadership of the mead hall by displaying the most impressive battle trophy on the great hall's pedestal. So long as the spirit of Hrothmund the Red consented, that warrior would be named chieftain.""},{""text1"":""For twenty-one years Hrothmund the Red ruled over Thirsk and its residents as chieftain. With his soft voice and great axe -- which was said to be the largest weapon of its kind ever wielded by a Nord -- Hrothmund brought peace and prosperity to Thirsk. But peace proved to be Hrothmund's undoing, for the mighty Nord grew restless in the warmth and safety of the mead hall. He longed for battle and adventure, to feel the frost in his veins once more, and could ignore the call of valor no longer. When word spread of a giant, bloodthirsty white wolf terrorizing travelers in the Moesring Mountains, Hrothmund took up his great axe and set out to defeat the beast alone. The men of the mountains named him Ondjage, the Fell Wolf. The beast measured as large as an ox, with fur as white as new-fallen snow, and it was said no man or woman alive could bring Ondjage down. The words of the mountain folk proved true, for while Hrothmund did hew one leg from the Fell Wolf, Ondjage devoured the mighty Nord whole, leaving only his great axe as a grim reminder of man's failure against beast. Filled with sorrow and rage, the residents of Thirsk marched to the mountains in search of the wolf, called by them Hrothmund's Bane. Only together did they manage to slay Ondjage, and as family they feasted on his roasted flesh.""},{""text1"":""The following is a list of Thirsk's chieftains, since Hrothmund first ruled:""},{""text1"":""Hrothmund the Red.

But while Thirsk itself did not grow, its inhabitants did, and before long the grand mead hall could not house all who wished to dwell within. So, over the years, many Nords have left Thirsk to establish their own private dwellings out in the wilderness of Solstheim, relying on the island's many caves and natural shelters. But those who left are always welcome back at Thirsk, and many return frequently to enjoy the mead hall's hospitalities. It is also important to note that although over a hundred years have passed since the group first left the Skaal village, the Skaal and Thirsk Nords have always remained civil to one another, and even trade resources on occasion.""},{""text1"":""Throughout the years, the Thirsk Nords and the Empire have entered into a simple but effective relationship: they leave each other alone and everyone is happy. Soon after arriving on Solstheim, the Imperials realized that their authority on the island was limited to Fort Frostmoth and vicinity. Solstheim was, is, and probably always will be a savage and frozen wasteland more suited to ancient Nord custom than conventional Imperial law. As long as the residents of Thirsk leave Fort Frostmoth in peace, the Imperials at Fort Frostmoth will reciprocate. In fact, the relationship between the two locations is fairly civil, and the Thirsk Nords gained considerable favor with the Empire when they delivered the Breton fugitive Alain Montrose to the garrison at Forth Frostmoth, after he attempted to hide out in Thirsk.""},{""text1"":""Within the Mead Hall, the Chieftain serves as judge, jury and executioner if necessary. The reality is that Thirsk has always been a fairly peaceful place, with camaraderie and goodwill the norm. Solstheim can be a harsh home, and the Nords of Thirsk have long realized that fighting each other isn't nearly as productive as battling the island's bears, wolves, draugrs, Rieklings, and whatever other fell creatures may roam the land. Still, there is the occasional disagreement - which more often than naught ends in bloodshed - and every few years someone gets it into his head to challenge the chieftain to a blood duel to try to gain possession of Thirsk. Generally speaking, the Nords of Thirsk are one big, happy barbarian-like family. And, like any family, they have their squabbles.""}]"

Every Hogithum, which we celebrate on the 21st of First Seed, we summon her for guidance, as well as to offer things of worth and beauty to Her Majesty. She is a cruel but wise mistress. We do not invoke her on any Hogithum troubled by thunderstorms, for those nights belong to the Mad One, Sheogorath, even if they do coincide with the occasion. Azura at such times understands our caution.""},{""text1"":""Azura's invocation is a very personal one. I have been priestess to three other Daedric Princes, but Azura values the quality of her worshippers, and the truth behind our adoration of her. When I was a Dark Elven maid of sixteen, I joined my grandmother's coven, worshippers of Molag Bal, the Schemer Princess. Blackmail, extortion, and bribery are as much the weapons of the Witches of Molag Bal as is dark magic. The Invocation of Molag Bal is held on the 20th of Evening Star, except during stormy weather. This ceremony is seldom missed, but Molag Bal often appears to her cultists in mortal guise on other dates. When my grandmother died in an attempt to poison the heir of Firewatch, I re-examined my faith in the cult.""},{""text1"":""My brother was a wizard of the cult of Boethiah-and from what he told me, the Dark Warrior was closer to my spirit than the treacherous Molag Bal. Boethiah is a Warrior Princess who acts more overtly than any other Daedroth. After years of skulking and scheming, it felt good to perform acts for a mistress which had direct, immediate consequences. Besides, I liked it that Boethiah was a Daedra of the Dark Elves. Our cult would summon her on the day we called the Gauntlet, the 2nd of Sun's Dusk. Bloody competitions would be held in her honor, and the duels and battles would continue until nine cultists were killed at the hands of other cultists. Boethiah cared little for her cultists-she only cared for our blood. I do think I saw her smile when I accidentally slew my brother in a sparring session. My horror, I think, greatly pleased her.""},{""text1"":""I left the cult soon after that. Boethiah was too impersonal for me, too cold. I wanted a mistress of greater depth. For the next eighteen years of my life, I worshipped no one. Instead I read and researched. It was in an old and profane tome that I came upon the name of Nocturnal-Nocturnal the Night Mistress, Nocturnal the Unfathomable. As the book prescribed, I called to her on her holy day, the 3rd of Hearth Fire. At last I had found the personal mistress I had so long desired. I strove to understand her labyrinthine philosophy, the source of her mysterious pain. Everything about her was dark and shrouded, even the way she spoke and the acts she required of me. It took years for me to understand the simple fact that I could never understand Nocturnal. Her mystery was as essential to her as savagery was to Boethiah or treachery was to Molag Bal. To understand Nocturnal is to negate her, to pull back the curtains cloaking her realm of darkness. As much as I loved her, I recognized the futility of unraveling her enigmas. I turned instead to her sister, Azura.""},{""text1"":""Azura is the only Daedra Princess I have ever worshipped who seems to care about her followers. Molag Bal wanted my mind, Boethiah wanted my arms, and Nocturnal perhaps my curiosity. Azura wants all of that, and our love above all. Not our abject slavering, but our honest and genuine caring in all its forms. It is important to her that our emotions be engaged in her worship. And our love must also be directed inward.

The  Warhammer was created in a fire, magically fueled by the Wizard, Dorach  Gusal, and was forged by the great weaponsmith, Hilbongard Rolamus.

Northern men considered them to be intelligent  dragons with lightning for blood. One such mighty beast, Haynekhtnamet,  was slain by the Northern men, though it took 7 days and nights, and a  score of men. One of the surviving men took a fang home as a trophy.

The Dagger mysteriously houses some of the beast's magical properties  and grants the user the ability to do shock damage on an opponent. This  unique Dagger is seen occasionally by traveling heroes.""},{""text1"":""The Umbra Sword was enchanted by the ancient witch Naenra Waerr, and its  sole purpose was the entrapment of souls. Used in conjunction with a  soul gem, the Sword allows the wielder the opportunity to imprison an  enemy's soul in the gem. Naenra was executed for her evil creation, but  not before she was able to hide the Sword. The Umbra Sword is very  choosy when it comes to owners and therefore remains hidden until a  worthy one is found.""},{""text1"":""All that is known of this Ring is that it may grant the user protection  from certain elements.

Wood  Elven legend claims Oreyn single handedly defeated Glenhwyfaunva, the  witch-serpent of the Elven wood, forever bringing peace to his clan.  Oreyn would go on to accomplish numerous other deeds, eventually losing  his life to the Knahaten Flu. His Helm stood as a monument of his  stature for future generations to remember.

Though  the Empire believes them all to be destroyed, it is rumored that one  still remains in existence, somewhere in Tamriel, though none have ever  seen it. The Blade lends it's weilder the ability to do great damage on  an enemy and allows him to paralyze and put heavy wear on his enemy's  armor.

They were always interested in simple solutions, the easy way, but people like Yana were always looking for exceptions, possibilities, exotica. For pragmatists like Arthcamu, it was intensely vexing.""},{""text1"":""The Redguard maiden would spend hours in front of a lock, prodding at it with her wires and picks, flirting with the key pins and driver pins, exploring the hull with a sort of casual fascination that no delinquent possesses. Long after her fellow students had opened their test locks and moved on, Yana was still playing with hers. The fact that she always opened it eventually, no matter how advanced a lock it was, irked Arthcamu even further.""},{""text1"":""\""You are making things much too difficult,\"" he would roar, boxing her ears. \""Speed is of the essence, not merely technical know-how.

Under the civilized peace of the Grand  Council, and with the strong central authority of the Temple, the  economic and military power of the settled Dunmer quickly outstripped  that of the nomadic Dunmer. The nomadic Dunmer were marginalized into  the poorest, most hostile land, in particular, into the Vvardenfell  wastes. For the Ashlanders, the return of a reincarnated Nerevar  represents a longed for and largely romanticized Golden Age of Nerevar's  Peace, when the nomadic tribes enjoyed equality with the settled  Dunmer, and before the Dunmer people had for the most part abandoned  traditional ancestor worship for the autocratic theocracy of the  Tribunal Temple.""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""This is the story of Nerevar as an Ashlander might tell it.""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""In ancient days, the Deep Elves and a great host of outlanders from the  West came to steal the land of the Dunmer. In that time, Nerevar was the  great khan and warleader of the House People, but he honored the  Ancient Spirits and the Tribal law, and became as one of us. So, when  Nerevar pledged upon his great Ring of the Ancestors,  One-Clan-Under-Moon-and-Star, to honor the ways of the Spirits and  rights of the Land, all the Tribes joined the House People to fight a  great battle at Red Mountain. Though many Dunmer, Tribesman and  Houseman, died at Red Mountain, the Dwemer were defeated and their evil  magicks destroyed, and the outlanders driven from the land. But after  this great victory, the power-hungry khans of the Great Houses slew  Nerevar in secret, and, setting themselves up as gods, neglected  Nerevar's promises to the Tribes. But it is said that Nerevar will come  again with his ring, and cast down the false gods, and by the power of  his ring will make good his promises to the Tribes, to honor the Spirits  and drive the outsiders from the land.""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""The Tribunal Temple regards the mysticism and prophecy of the Nerevarine  cult as primitive superstition. The Ashlander Ancestor cults and the  Nerevarines in particular have always decried the worship of living  Dunmer as abominations, suspecting the unnatural lifetimes of the  Tribunal to be signs of profane sorcery or necromancy. Though the  authoritarian and intolerant Temple priesthood has always been inclined  to tolerate Ashlander ancestor cult practices, they have always  threatened Nerevarine claimants with death or imprisonment. And while  generally tolerant of various cult worships, the Imperial Commission of  the Occupation outlaws cults hostile to the Emperor and the Empire, and  threatens members of such cults with imprisonment or death. The  Ordinators are allowed a free hand when dealing with outlawed cults like  the Nerevarines.""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""In the past, others have claimed to be the reincarnated Nerevar of  prophecy. The most recent is known as Peakstar, a mysterious figure who  has reportedly appeared and disappeared among the Wastes tribes over the  last 30 years. The Temple notes that these False Incarnates discredit  the Nerevarine prophecies. Singularly, and illogically, the Ashlanders  acknowledge a history of false claimants, calling them \""Failed  Incarnates,\"" but they regard them as proof of the validity of the  prophecies, rather than contradiction. Among the Nerevarines there is a  fable of a Cavern of the Incarnates, where the spirits of the Failed  Incarnates dwell. The Nerevarine cult is a mystical cult, and it  glorifies, rather than shrinks from, contradictions.""}]"

Evidently, so did our enemies.\""""},{""text"":""\""I thought the war was over,\"" muttered one of the caravan's now ruined merchants.""},{""text"":""The Bosmer laughed again: \""No act of war. Just a little border enterprise. You are going on to Falinesti?\""""},{""text"":""\""I'm not,\"" the convoy head shook his head. \""As far as I'm concerned, my duty is done. No more horses, no more caravan. Just a fat profit loss to me.\""""},{""text"":""The men and women crowded around the man, protesting, threatening, begging, but he refused to step foot in Valenwood. If these were the new times of peace, he said, he'd rather come back for the next war.""},{""text"":""Scotti tried a different route and approached the Bosmer. He spoke with an authoritative but friendly voice, the kind he used in negotiations with peevish carpenters: \""I don't suppose you'd consider escorting me to Falinesti. I'm a representative for an important Imperial agency, the Atrius Building Commission, here to help repair and alleviate some of the problems the war with the Khajiit brought to your province.  Patriotism --\""""},{""text"":""\""Twenty gold pieces, and you must carry your own gear if you have any left,\"" replied the Bosmer.""},{""text"":""Scotti reflected that negotiations with peevish carpenters rarely went his way either.""},{""text"":""Six eager people had enough gold on them for payment. Among those without funds was the poet, who appealed to Scotti for assistance.""},{""text"":""\""I'm sorry, Gryf, I only have fourteen gold left over. Not even enough for a decent room when I get to Falinesti. I really would help you if I could,\"" said Scotti, persuading himself that it was true.""},{""text"":""The band of six and their Bosmer escorts began the descent down a rocky path along the bluff. Within an hour's time, they were deep in the jungles of Valenwood.  A never-ending canopy of hues of browns and greens obscured the sky. A millennia's worth of fallen leaves formed a deep, wormy sea of putrefaction beneath their feet. Several miles were crossed wading through the slime.  For several more, they took a labyrinthian path across fallen branches and the low-hanging boughs of giant trees.""},{""text"":""All the while, hour after hour, the inexhaustible Bosmer host moved so fast, the Cyrodiils struggled to keep from being left behind. A red-faced little merchant with short legs took a bad step on a rotten branch and nearly fell. His fellow provincials had to help him up. The Bosmer paused only a moment, their eyes continually darting to the shadows in the trees above before moving on at their usual expeditious pace.""},{""text"":""\""What are they so nervous about?\"" wheezed the merchant irritably. \""More Cathay-Raht?\""""},{""text"":""\""Don't be ridiculous,\"" laughed the Bosmer unconvincingly. \""Khajiit this far into Valenwood? In times of peace? They'd never dare.\""""},{""text"":""When the group passed high enough above the swamp that the smell was somewhat dissipated, Scotti felt a sudden pang of hunger. He was used to four meals a day in the Cyrodilic custom. Hours of nonstop exertion without food was not part of his regimen as a comfortably paid clerk. He pondered, feeling somewhat delirious, how long they had been trotting through the jungle. Twelve hours?  Twenty? A week? Time was meaningless. Sunlight was only sporadic through the vegetative ceiling. Phosphorescent molds on the trees and in the muck below provided the only regular illumination.""},{""text"":""\""Is it at all possible for us to rest and eat?\"" he hollered to his host up ahead.""},{""text"":""\""We're near to Falinesti,\"" came the echoing reply. \""Lots of food there.\""""},{""text"":""The path continued upward for several hours more across a clot of fallen logs, rising up to the first and then the second boughs of the tree line. As they rounded a long corner, the travelers found themselves midway up a waterfall that fell a hundred feet or more. No one had the energy to complain as they began pulling up the stacks of rock, agonizing foot by foot. The Bosmer escorts disappeared into the mist, but Scotti kept climbing until there was no more rock left. He wiped the sweat and river water from his eyes.""},{""text"":""Falinesti spread across the horizon before him. Sprawling across both banks of the river stood the mighty graht-oak city, with groves and orchards of lesser trees crowding it like supplicants before their king. At a lesser scale, the tree that formed the moving city would have been extraordinary: gnarled and twisted with a gorgeous crown of gold and green, dripping with vines and shining with sap. At a mile tall and half as wide, it was the most magnificent thing Scotti had ever seen. If he had not been a starving man with the soul of a clerk, he would have sung.""},{""text"":""\""There you are,\"" said the leader of the escorts. \""Not too far a walk. You should be glad it's wintertide. In summertide, the city's on the far south end of the province.\""""},{""text"":""Scotti was lost as to how to proceed. The sight of the vertical metropolis where people moved about like ants disoriented all his sensibilities.""},{""text"":""\""You wouldn't know of an inn called,\"" he paused for a moment, and then pulled Jurus's letter from his pocket. \""Something like 'Mother Paskos Tavern'?\""""},{""text"":""\""Mother Pascost?\"" the lead Bosmer laughed his familiar contemptuous laugh. \""You won't want to stay there? Visitors always prefer the Aysia Hall in the top boughs.  It's expensive, but very nice.\""""},{""text"":""\""I'm meeting someone at Mother Pascost's Tavern.\""""},{""text"":""\""If you've made up your mind to go, take a lift to Havel Slump and ask for directions there. Just don't get lost and fall asleep in the western cross.\""""},{""text"":""This apparently struck the youth's friends as a very witty jest, and so it was with their laughter echoing behind him that Scotti crossed the writhing root system to the base of Falinesti. The ground was littered with leaves and refuse, and from moment to moment a glass or a bone would plummet from far above, so he walked with his neck crooked to have warning. An intricate network of platforms anchored to thick vines slipped up and down the slick trunk of the city with perfect grace, manned by operators with arms as thick as an ox's belly. Scotti approaches the nearest fellow at one of the platforms, who was idly smoking from a glass pipe.""},{""text"":""\""I was wondering if you might take me to Havel Slump.\""""},{""text"":""The mer nodded and within a few minutes time, Scotti was two hundred feet in the air at a crook between two mighty branches. Curled webs of moss stretched unevenly across the fork, forming a sharing roof for several dozen small buildings.  There were only a few souls in the alley, but around the bend ahead, he could hear the sound of music and people. Scotti tipped the Falinesti Platform Ferryman a gold piece and asked for the location of Mother Pascost's Tavern.""},{""text"":""\""Straight ahead of you, sir, but you won't find anyone there,\"" the Ferryman explained, pointing in the direction of the noise. \""Morndas everyone in Havel Slump has revelry.\""""},{""text"":""Scotti walked carefully along the narrow street. Though the ground felt as solid as the marble avenues of the Imperial City, there were slick cracks in the bark that exposed fatal drops into the river. He took a moment to sit down, to rest and get used to the view from the heights. It was a beautiful day for certain, but it took Scotti only a few minutes of contemplation to rise up in alarm. A jolly little raft anchored down stream below him had distinctly moved several inches while he watched it.  But it hadn't moved at all. He had. Together with everything around him. It was no metaphor: the city of Falinesti walked. And, considering its size, it moved quickly.""},{""text"":""Scotti rose to his feet and into a cloud of smoke that drifted out from around the bend. It was the most delicious roast he had ever smelled. The clerk forgot his fear and ran.""},{""text"":""The \""revelry\"" as the Ferryman had termed it took place on an enormous platform tied to the tree, wide enough to be a plaza in any other city. A fantastic assortment of the most amazing people Scotti had ever seen were jammed shoulder-to-shoulder together, many eating, many more drinking, and some dancing to a lutist and singer perched on an offshoot above the crowd.  They were largely Bosmer, true natives clad in colorful leather and bones, with a close minority of orcs.  Whirling through the throng, dancing and bellowing at one another were a hideous ape people. A few heads bobbing over the tops of the crowd belonged not, as Scotti first assumed, to very tall people, but to a family of centaurs.""},{""text"":""\""Care for some mutton?\"" queried a wizened old mer who roasted an enormous beast on some red-hot rocks.""},{""text"":""Scotti quickly paid him a gold piece and devoured the leg he was given.  And then another gold piece and another leg. The fellow chuckled when Scotti began choking on a piece of gristle, and handed him a mug of a frothing white drink. He drank it and felt a quiver run through his body as if he were being tickled.""},{""text"":""\""What is that?\"" Scotti asked.""},{""text"":""\""Jagga. Fermented pig's milk. I can let you have a flagon of it and a bit more mutton for another gold.\""""},{""text"":""Scotti agreed, paid, gobbled down the meat, and took the flagon with him as he slipped into the crowd.  His co-worker Liodes Jurus, the man who had told him to come to Valenwood, was nowhere to be seen. When the flagon was a quarter empty, Scotti stopped looking for Jurus.  When it was half empty, he was dancing with the group, oblivious to the broken planks and gaps in the fencework.  At three quarters empty, he was trading jokes with a group of creatures whose language was completely alien to him. By the time the flagon was completely drained, he was asleep, snoring, while the revelry continued on all around his supine body.""},{""text"":""The next morning, still asleep, Scotti had the sensation of someone kissing him.  He made a face to return the favor, but a pain like fire spread through his chest and forced him to open his eyes. There was an insect the size of a large calf sitting on him, crushing him, its spiky legs holding him down while a central spiral-bladed vortex of a mouth tore through his shirt. He screamed and thrashed but the beast was too strong. It had found its meal and it was going to finish it.""},{""text"":""It's over, thought Scotti wildly, I should have never left home. I could have stayed in the City, and perhaps found work with Lord Vanech. I could have begun again as a junior clerk and worked my way back up.""},{""text"":""Suddenly the mouth released itself. The creature shivered once, expelled a burst of yellow bile, and died.""},{""text"":""\""Got one!\"" cried a voice, not too distantly.""},{""text"":""For a moment, Scotti lay still. His head throbbed and his chest burned. Out of the corner of his eye he saw movement. Another of the horrible monsters was scurried towards him. He scrambled, trying to push himself free, but before he could come out, there was a sound of a bow cracking and an arrow pierced the second insect.""},{""text"":""\""Good shot!\"" cried another voice. \""Get the first one again! I just saw it move a little!\""""},{""text"":""This time, Scotti felt the impact of the bolt hit the carcass. He cried out, but he could hear how muffled his voice was by the beetle's body. Cautiously, he tried sliding a foot out and rolling under, but the movement apparently had the effect of convincing the archers that the creature still lived. A volley of arrows was launched forth. Now the beast was sufficiently perforated so pools of its blood, and likely the blood of its victims, began to seep out onto Scotti's body.""},{""text"":""When Scotti was a lad, before he grew too sophisticated for such sports, he had often gone to the Imperial Arena for the competitions of war. He recalled a great veteran of the fights, when asked, telling him his secret, \""Whenever I'm in doubt of what to do, and I have a shield, I stay behind it.\""""},{""text"":""Scotti followed that advice. After an hour, when he no longer heard arrows being fired, he threw aside the remains of the bug and leapt as quickly as he could to a stand. It was not a moment too soon. A gang of eight archers had their bows pointing his direction, ready to fire. When they saw him, they laughed.""},{""text"":""\""Didn't anyone ever tell you not to sleep in the western cross? How're we going to exterminate all the hoarvors if you drunks keep feeding 'em?\""""},{""text"":""Scotti shook his head and walked back along the platform, round the bend, to Havel Slump. He was bloodied and torn and tired and he had far too much fermented pig's milk. All he wanted was a proper place to lie down. He stepped into Mother Pascost's Tavern, a dank place, wet with sap, smelling of mildew.""},{""text"":""\""My name is Decumus Scotti,\"" he said. \""I was hoping you have someone named Jurus staying here.\""""},{""text"":""\""Decumus Scotti?\"" pondered the fleshy proprietress, Mother Pascost herself. \""I've heard that name. Oh, you must be the fellow he left the note for. Let me go see if I can find it.\""""},{""text"":""A Dance in Fire, v3""},{""text"":""A Dance in Fire\nChapter 3""},{""text"":""by\nWaughin Jarth""},{""text"":""Mother Pascost disappeared into the sordid hole that was her tavern, and emerged a moment later with a scrap of paper with Liodes Jurus's familiar scrawl.  Decumus Scotti held it up before a patch of sunlight that had found its way through the massive boughs of the tree city, and read.""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":""Sckotti,\nSo you made it to Falinnesti, Vallinwood!

Meat me down here as son as you can.\nJurus""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":""So, Scotti pondered, Jurus had left Falinesti and gone to some place called Athie.  Given his poor penmanship and ghastly spelling, it could equally well be Athy, Aphy, Othry, Imthri, Urtha, or Krakamaka.  The sensible thing to do, Scotti knew, was to call this adventure over and try to find some way to get back home to the Imperial City.  He was no mercenary devoted to a life of thrills: he was, or at least had been, a senior clerk at a successful private building commission.  Over the last few weeks, he had been robbed by the Cathay-Raht, taken on a death march through the jungle by a gang of giggling Bosmeri, half-starved to death, drugged with fermented pig's milk, nearly slain by some kind of giant tick, and attacked by archers.  He was filthy, exhausted, and had, he counted, ten gold pieces to his name.  Now the man whose proposal brought him to the depths of misery was not even there.  It was both judicious and seemly to abandon the enterprise entirely.""},{""text"":""And yet, a small but distinct voice in his head told him: You have been chosen.  You have no other choice but to see this through.""},{""text"":""Scotti turned to the stout old woman, Mother Pascost, who had been watching him curiously: \""I was wondering if you knew of a village that was at the edge of the recent conflict with Elsweyr.  It's called something like Ath-ie?\""""},{""text"":""\""You must mean Athay,\"" she grinned. \""My middle lad, Viglil, he manages a dairy down there.  Beautiful country, right on the river.  Is that where your friend went?\""""},{""text"":""\""Yes,\"" said Scotti. \""Do you know the fastest way to get there?\""""},{""text"":""After a short conversation, an even shorter ride to Falinesti's roots by way of the platforms, and a jog to the river bank, Scotti was negotiating transport with a huge fair-haired Bosmer with a face like a pickled carp.  He called himself Captain Balfix, but even Scotti with his sheltered life could recognize him for what he was.  A retired pirate for hire, a smuggler for certain, and probably much worse.  His ship, which had clearly been stolen in the distant past, was a bent old Imperial sloop.""},{""text"":""\""Fifty gold and we'll be in Athay in two days time,\"" boomed Captain Balfix expansively.""},{""text"":""\""I have ten, no, sorry, nine gold pieces,\"" replied Scotti, and feeling the need for explanation, added, \""I had ten, but I gave one to the Platform Ferryman to get me down here.\""""},{""text"":""\""Nine is just as fine,\"" said the captain agreeably. \""Truth be told, I was going to Athay whether you paid me or not.  Make yourself comfortable on the boat, we'll be leaving in just a few minutes.\""""},{""text"":""Decumus Scotti boarded the vessel, which sat low in the water of the river, stacked high with crates and sacks that spilled out of the hold and galley and onto the deck.  Each was marked with stamps advertising the most innocuous substances: copper scraps, lard, ink, High Rock meal (marked \""For Cattle\""), tar, fish jelly.  Scotti's imagination reeled picturing what sorts of illicit imports were truly aboard.""},{""text"":""It took more than those few minutes for Captain Balfix to haul in the rest of his cargo, but in an hour, the anchor was up and they were sailing downriver towards Athay.  The green gray water barely rippled, only touched by the fingers of the breeze.  Lush plant life crowded the banks, obscuring from sight all the animals that sang and roared at one another.  Lulled by the serene surroundings, Scotti drifted to sleep.""},{""text"":""At night, he awoke and gratefully accepted some clean clothes and food from Captain Balfix.""},{""text"":""\""Why are you going to Athay, if I may ask?\"" queried the Bosmer.""},{""text"":""\""I'm meeting a former colleague there.  He asked me to come down from the Imperial City where I worked for the Atrius Building Commission to negotiate some contracts,\"" Scotti took another bite of the dried sausages they were sharing for dinner. \""We're going to try to repair and refurbish whatever bridges, roads, and other structures that got damaged in the recent war with the Khajiiti.\""""},{""text"":""\""It's been a hard two years,\"" the captain nodded his head. \""Though I suppose good for me and the likes of you and your friend.

Now they think there's going to be war with the Summurset Isles, you heard that?\""""},{""text"":""Scotti shook his head.""},{""text"":""\""I've done my share of smuggling skooma down the coast, even helping some revolutionary types escape the Mane's wrath, but now the wars've made me a legitimate trader, a business-man.  The first casualties of war is always the corrupted.\""""},{""text"":""Scotti said he was sorry to hear that, and they lapsed into silence, watching the stars and moons' reflection on the still water.   The next day, Scotti awoke to find the captain wrapped up in his sail, torpid from alcohol, singing in a low, slurred voice.  When he saw Scotti rise, he offered his flagon of jagga.""},{""text"":""\""I learned my lesson during revelry at western cross.\""""},{""text"":""The captain laughed, and then burst into tears, \""I don't want to be legitimate.  Other pirates I used to know are still raping and stealing and smuggling and selling nice folk like you into slavery.  I swear to you, I never thought the first time that I ran a real shipment of legal goods that my life would turn out like this.  Oh, I know, I could go back to it, but Baan Dar knows not after all I've seen.  I'm a ruined man.\""""},{""text"":""Scotti helped the weeping mer out of the sail, murmuring words of reassurance.  Then he added, \""Forgive me for changing the subject, but where are we?\""""},{""text"":""\""Oh,\"" moaned Captain Balfix miserably. \""We made good time.  Athay's right around the bend in the river.\""""},{""text"":""\""Then it looks like Athay's on fire,\"" said Scotti, pointing.""},{""text"":""A great plume of smoke black as pitch was rising above the trees.  As they drifted around the bend, they next saw the flames, and then the blackened skeletal remains of the village.  Dying, blazing villagers leapt from rocks into the river.  A cacophony of wailing met their ears, and they could see, roaming along the edges of the town, the figures of Khajiiti soldiers bearing torches.""},{""text"":""\""Baan Dar bless me!\"" slurred the captain. \""The war's back on!\""""},{""text"":""\""Oh, no,\"" whimpered Scotti.""},{""text"":""The sloop drifted with the current toward the opposite shore away from the fiery town.  Scotti turned his attention there, and the sanctuary it offered.  Just a peaceful arbor, away from the horror.  There was a shudder of leaves in two of the trees and a dozen lithe Khajiit dropped to the ground, armed with bows.""},{""text"":""\""They see us,\"" hissed Scotti. \""And they've got bows!\""""},{""text"":""\""Well, of course they have bows,\"" snarled Captain Balfix. \""We Bosmer may have invented the bloody things, but we didn't think to keep them secret, you bloody bureaucrat.\""""},{""text"":""\""Now, they're setting their arrows on fire!\""""},{""text"":""\""Yes, they do that sometimes.\""""},{""text"":""\""Captain, they're shooting at us!  They're shooting at us with flaming arrows!\""""},{""text"":""\""Ah, so they are,\"" the captain agreed. \""The aim here is to avoid being hit.\""""},{""text"":""But hit they were, and very shortly thereafter.  Even worse, the second volley of arrows hit the supply of pitch, which ignited in a tremendous blue blaze.  Scotti grabbed Captain Balfix and they leapt overboard just before the ship and all its cargo disintegrated.  The shock of the cold water brought the Bosmer into temporary sobriety.  He called to Scotti, who was already swimming as fast as he could toward the bend.""},{""text"":""\""Master Decumus, where do you think you're swimming to?\""""},{""text"":""\""Back to Falinesti!\"" cried Scotti.""},{""text"":""\""It will take you days, and by the time you get there, everyone will know about the attack on Athay!  They'll never let anyone they don't know in!  The closest village downriver is Grenos, maybe they'll give us shelter!\""""},{""text"":""Scotti swam back to the captain and side-by-side they began paddling in the middle of the river, past the burning residuum of the village.  He thanked Mara that he had learned to swim.  Many a Cyrodiil did not, as largely land-locked as the Imperial Province was.  Had he been raised in Mir Corrup or Artemon, he might have been doomed, but the Imperial City itself was encircled by water, and every lad and lass there knew how to cross without a boat.  Even those who grew up to be clerks and not adventurers.""},{""text"":""Captain Balfix's sobriety faded as he grew used to the water's temperature.  Even in wintertide, the Xylo River was fairly temperate and after a fashion, even comfortable.  The Bosmer's strokes were uneven, and he'd stray closer to Scotti and then further away, pushing ahead and then falling behind.""},{""text"":""Scotti looked to the shore to his right: the flames had caught the trees like tinder.  Behind them was an inferno, with which they were barely keeping pace.  To the shore on their left, all looked fair, until he saw a tremble in the river-reeds, and then what caused it.  A pride of the largest cats he had ever seen.  They were auburn-haired, green-eyed beasts with jaws and teeth to match his wildest nightmares.  And they were watching the two swimmers, and keeping pace.""},{""text"":""\""Captain Balfix, we can't go to either that shore or the other one, or we'll be parboiled or eaten,\"" Scotti whispered. \""Try to even your kicking and your strokes.  Breath like you would normally.  If you're feeling tired, tell me, and we'll float on our backs for a while.\""""},{""text"":""Anyone who has had the experience of giving rational advice to a drunkard would understand the hopelessness.  Scotti kept pace with the captain, slowing himself, quickening, drifting left and right, while the Bosmer moaned old ditties from his pirate days.  When he wasn't watching his companion, he watched the cats on the shore.  After a stretch, he turned to his right.  Another village had caught fire.  Undoubtedly, it was Grenos.  Scotti stared at the blazing fury, awed by the sight of the destruction, and did not hear that the captain had ceased to sing.""},{""text"":""When he turned back, Captain Balfix was gone.""},{""text"":""Scotti dove into the murky depths of the river over and over again.  There was nothing to be done.  When he surfaced after his final search, he saw that the giant cats had moved on, perhaps assuming that he too had drowned.  He continued his lonely swim downriver.  A tributary, he noted, had formed a final barrier, keeping the flames from spreading further.  But there were no more towns.  After several hours, he began to ponder the wisdom of going ashore.  Which shore was the question.""},{""text"":""He was spared the decision.  Ahead of him was a rocky island with a bonfire.  He did not know if he were intruding on a party of Bosmeri or Khajiiti, only that he could swim no more.

They were the survivors of both the villages of Grenos and Athay, and war was on every person's lips.  Why had the Khajiiti attacked again?

For Decumus Scotti, the jungle was hostile, unfamiliar ground. The enormous vermiculated trees filled the bright morning with darkness, and resembled nothing so much as grasping claws, bent on impeding their progress. Even the fronds of the low plants quivered with malevolent energy. What was worse, he was not alone in his anxiety. His fellow travelers, the natives who had survived the Khajiit attacks on the villages of Grenos and Athay, wore faces of undisguised fear.""},{""text"":""There was something sentient in the jungle, and not merely the mad but benevolent indigenous spirits. In his peripheral vision, Scotti could see the shadows of the Khajiiti following the refugees, leaping from tree to tree.

And the Bosmeri saw them too, and quickened their pace.""},{""text"":""After eighteen hours, bitten raw by insects, scratched by a thousand thorns, they emerged into a valley clearing. It was night, but a row of blazing torches greeted them, illuminating the leather-wrought tents and jumbled stones of the hamlet of Vindisi. At the end of the valley, the torches marked a sacred site, a gnarled bower of trees pressed closed together to form a temple. Wordlessly, the Bosmeri walked the torch arcade toward the trees. Scotti followed them. When they reached the solid mass of living wood with only one gaping portal, Scotti could see a dim blue light glowing within. A low sonorous moan from a hundred voices echoed within. The Bosmeri maiden he had been following held out her hand, stopping him.""},{""text"":""\""You do not understand, but no outsider, not even a friend may enter,\"" she said. \""This is a holy place.\""""},{""text"":""Scotti nodded, and watched the refugees march into the temple, heads bowed.

He wrote to me, asking that I represent an Imperial building commission and contract some post-war construction.  I had just been released from my employment, and I thought that if I brought some new business, I could have my job back. Jurus and I met in Athay, and he said he was going to arrange a very lucrative meeting with the Silvenar.\""""},{""text"":""Scotti was stunned: \""Where is he now?\""""},{""text"":""\""I'm no theologian, so I couldn't say,\"" Reglius shrugged. \""He's dead. When the Khajiiti attacked Athay, they began by torching the harbor where Jurus was readying his boat. Or, I should say, my boat since it was purchased with the gold I brought. By the time we were even aware of what was happening enough to flee, everything by the water was ash. The Khajiiti may be animals, but they know how to arrange an attack.\""""},{""text"":""\""I think they followed us through the jungle to Vindisi,\"" said Scotti nervously. \""There was definitely a group of something jumping along the treetops.\""""},{""text"":""\""Probably one of the monkey folk,\"" snorted the Nord. \""Nothing to be concerned about.\""""},{""text"":""\""When we first came to Vindisi and the Bosmeri all entered that tree, they were furious, whispering something about unleashing an ancient terror on their enemies,\"" the Breton shivered, remembering. \""They've been there ever since, for over a day and a half now. If you want something to be afraid of, that's the direction to look.\""""},{""text"":""The other Breton, who was a representative of the Daggerfall Mages Guild, was staring off into the darkness while his fellow provincial spoke. \""Maybe. But there's something in the jungle too, right on the edge of the village, looking in.\""""},{""text"":""\""More refugees maybe?\"" asked Scotti, trying to keep the alarm out his voice.""},{""text"":""\""Not unless they're traveling through the trees now,\"" whispered the wizard. The Nord and one of the Cyrodiils grabbed a long tarp of wet leather and pulled it across the fire, instantly extinguishing it without so much as a sizzle. Now Scotti could see the intruders, their elliptical yellow eyes and long cruel blades catching the torchlight. He froze with fear, praying that he too was not so visible to them.""},{""text"":""He felt something bump against his back, and gasped.""},{""text"":""Reglius's voice hissed from up above: \""Be quiet for Mara's sake and climb up here.\""""},{""text"":""Scotti grabbed hold of the knotted double-vine that hung down from a tall tree at the edge of the dead campfire. He scrambled up it as quickly as he could, holding his breath lest any grunt of exertion escape him. At the top of the vine, high above the village, was an abandoned nest from some great bird in a trident-shaped branch. As soon as Scotti had pulled himself into the soft, fragrant straw, Reglius pulled up the vine. No one else was there, and when Scotti looked down, he could see no one below. No one, that is except the Khajiiti, slowly moving toward the glow of the temple tree.""},{""text"":""\""Thank you,\"" whispered Scotti, deeply touched that a competitor had helped him. He turned away from the village, and saw that the tree's upper branches brushed against the mossy rock walls that surrounded the valley below. \""How are you at climbing?\""""},{""text"":""\""You're mad,\"" said Reglius under his breath. \""We should stay here until they leave.\""""},{""text"":""\""If they burn Vindisi like they did Athay and Grenos, we'll be dead sure as if we were on the ground,\"" Scotti began the slow careful climb up the tree, testing each branch. \""Can you see what they're doing?\""""},{""text"":""\""I can't really tell,\"" Reglius stared down into the gloom. \""They're at the front of the temple. I think they also have ... it looks like long ropes, trailing off behind them, off into the pass.\""""},{""text"":""Scotti crawled onto the strongest branch that pointed toward the wet, rocky face of the cliff. It was not a far jump at all. So close, in fact, that he could smell the moisture and feel the coolness of the stone. But it was a jump nevertheless, and in his history as a clerk, he had never before leapt from a tree a hundred feet off the ground to a sheer rock. He pictured in his mind's eye the shadows that had pursued him through the jungle from the heights above. How their legs coiled to spring, how their arms snapped forward in an elegant fluid motion to grasp. He leapt.""},{""text"":""His hands grappled for rock, but long thick cords of moss were more accessible. He held hard, but when he tried to plant his feet forward, they slipped up skyward. For a few seconds, he found himself upside down before he managed to pull himself into a more conventional position. There was a narrow outcropping jutting out of the cliff where he could stand and finally exhale.""},{""text"":""\""Reglius. Reglius. Reglius,\"" Scotti did not dare to call out. In a minute, there was a shaking of branches, and Lord Vanech's man emerged. First his satchel, then his head, then the rest of him. Scotti started to whisper something, but Reglius shook his head violently and pointed downward. One of the Khajiiti was at the base of the tree, peering at the remains of the campfire.""},{""text"":""Reglius awkwardly tried to balance himself on the branch, but as strong as it was it was exceedingly difficult with only one free hand. Scotti cupped his palms and then pointed at the satchel. It seemed to pain Reglius to let it out of his grasp, but he relented and tossed it to Scotti.""},{""text"":""There was a small, almost invisible hole in the bag, and when Scotti caught it, a single gold coin dropped out. It rang as it bounced against the rock wall on the descent, a high soft sound that seemed like the loudest alarm Scotti had ever heard.""},{""text"":""Then many things happened very quickly.""},{""text"":""The Cathay-Raht at the base of the tree looked up and gave a loud wail. The other Khajiiti followed in chorus, as the cat below crouched down and then sprung up into the lower branches. Reglius saw it below him, climbing up with impossible dexterity, and panicked. Even before he jumped, Scotti could tell that he was going to fall. With a cry, Reglius the Clerk plunged to the ground, breaking his neck on impact.""},{""text"":""A flash of white fire erupted from every crevice of the temple, and the moan of the Bosmeri prayer changed into something terrible and otherworldly. The climbing Cathay-Raht stopped and stared.""},{""text"":""\""Keirgo,\"" it gasped. \""The Wild Hunt.\""""},{""text"":""It was as if a crack in reality had opened wide. A flood of horrific beasts, tentacled toads, insects of armor and spine, gelatinous serpents, vaporous beings with the face of gods, all poured forth from the great hollow tree, blind with fury. They tore the Khajiiti in front of the temple to pieces. All the other cats fled for the jungle, but as they did so, they began pulling on the ropes they carried. In a few seconds time, the entire village of Vindisi was boiling with the lunatic apparitions of the Wild Hunt.""},{""text"":""Over the babbling, barking, howling horde, Scotti heard the Cyrodiils in hiding cry out as they were devoured. The Nord too was found and eaten, and both Bretons. The wizard had turned himself invisible, but the swarm did not rely on their sight. The tree the Cathay-Raht was in began to sway and rock from the impossible violence beneath it. Scotti looked at the Khajiiti's fear-struck eyes, and held out one of the cords of moss.""},{""text"":""The cat's face showed its pitiful gratitude as it leapt for the vine. It didn't have time to entirely replace that expression when Scotti pulled back the cord, and watched it fall. The Hunt consumed it to the bone before it struck the ground.""},{""text"":""Scotti's own jump up to the next outcropping of rock was immeasurably more successful. From there, he pulled himself to the top of the cliff and was able to look down into the chaos that had been the village of Vindisi. The Hunt's mass had grown and began to spill out through the pass out of the valley, pursuing the fleeing Khajiiti. It was then that the madness truly began.""},{""text"":""In the moons' light, from Scotti's vantage, he could see where the Khajiiti had attached their ropes. With a thunderous boom, an avalanche of boulders poured over the pass. When the dust cleared, he saw that the valley had been sealed. The Wild Hunt had nowhere to turn but on itself.""},{""text"":""Scotti turned his head, unable to bear to look at the cannibalistic orgy. The night jungle stood before him, a web of wood. He slung Reglius's satchel over his shoulder, and entered.""},{""text"":""A Dance in Fire, v5""},{""text"":""A Dance in Fire""},{""text"":""Chapter 5""},{""text"":""\nby\nWaughin Jarth""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":""\n\""Soap!

He stared off into the dim jungle glade from which he only heard animal and insect calls, and the low whistling of wind moments before.  It was a queer, oddly accented voice of indiscriminate gender, tremulous in its modulations, but unmistakably human.  Or, at very least, elven.  An isolated Bosmer perhaps with a poor grasp of the Cyrodilic language.  After countless hours of plodding through the dense knot of Valenwood jungle, any voice of slight familiarity sounded wondrous.""},{""text"":""\""Hello?\"" he cried.""},{""text"":""\""Beetles on any names?

I wasn't sure, I wasn't even sure how far away from the border I am now,\"" Scotti began slowly walking toward the tree.  He dropped Reglius's satchel to the ground, and held out his empty hands. \""I'm unarmed.  I only want to know the way to the closest town.  I'm trying to meet my friend, Liodes Jurus, in Silvenar.\""""},{""text"":""\""Silvenar!\"" the voice laughed.  It laughed even louder as Scotti circled the tree. \""Worms and wine!  Worms and wine!  Silvenar sings for worms and wine!\""""},{""text"":""There was nothing to be found anywhere around the tree. \""I don't see you.  Why are you hiding?\""""},{""text"":""In frustration born of hunger and exhaustion, he struck the tree trunk.  A sudden shiver of gold and red erupted from a hollow nook above, and Scotti was surrounded by six winged creatures scarcely more than a few inches long.  Bright crimson eyes were set on either side of tunnel-like protuberances, the animals' always open mouths.  They were legless, and their thin, rapidly beating, aureate wings seemed poorly constructed to transport their fat, swollen bellies.  And yet, they darted through the air like sparks from a fire.  Whirling about the poor clerk, they began chattering what he now understood to be perfect nonsense.""},{""text"":""\""Wines and worms, how far from the border am I!  Academic garnishments, and alas, Liodes Jurus!\""""},{""text"":""\""Hello, I'm afraid I'm unarmed?

Why are you hiding?  Before I begin to friend, love me, Lady Zuleika!\""""},{""text"":""Furious with the mimics, Scotti swung his arms, driving them up into the treetops.  He stomped back to the clearing and opened up the satchel again, as he had done some hours before.  There was still, unsurprisingly, nothing useful in the bag, and nothing to eat in any corner or pocket.  A goodly amount of gold (he smiled grimly, as he had done before, at the irony of being financially solvent in the jungle), a stack of neat blank contracts from Lord Vanech's building commission, some thin cord, and an oiled leather cloak for bad weather.  At least, Scotti considered, he had not suffered rain.""},{""text"":""A rolling moan of thunder reminded Scotti of what he had suspected for some weeks now.  He was cursed.""},{""text"":""Within an hour's time, he was wearing the cloak and clawing his way through mud.  The trees, which had earlier allowed no sunlight in, provided no shelter against the pounding storm and wind.  The only sounds that pierced the pelting of the rain were the mocking calls of the flying creatures, flitting just above, babbling their nonsense.  Scotti bellowed at them, threw rocks, but they seemed enamored of his company.""},{""text"":""While he was reaching to grab a promising looking stone to hurl at his tormentors, Scotti felt something shift beneath his feet.  Wet but solid ground suddenly liquefied and became a rolling tide, rushing him forward.  Light as a leaf, he flew head over feet over head, until the mudflow dropped and he continued forward, plunging down into a river twenty-five feet below.""},{""text"":""The storm passed quite as instantly as it had arrived.  The sun melted the dark clouds and warmed Scotti as he swam for the shore.  There, another sign of the Khajiiti incursion into Valenwood greeted him.  A small fishing village had stood there once, so recently extinct that it smoldered like a still-warm corpse.  Dirt cairns that had once housed fish by the smell of them had been ravaged, their bounty turned to ash.  Rafts and skiffs lay broken, scuttled, half-submerged.  All the villagers were no more, either dead or refugees far away.  Or so he presumed.  Something banged against the wall of one of the ruins.  Scotti ran to investigate.""},{""text"":""\""My name is Decumus Scotti?\"" sang the first winged beast. \""I'm a Cyrodiil from?  The Imperial City?  I came here to help rebuild Valenwood after the war, you see, and now I'm rather lost?\""""},{""text"":""\""I swell to maculate, apeneck!\"" agreed one of its companions. \""I don't see you.  Why are you hiding?\""""},{""text"":""As they fell into chattering, Scotti began to search the rest of the village.  Surely the cats had left something behind, a scrap of dried meat, a morsel of fish sausage, anything.  But they had been immaculate in their complete annihilation.  There was nothing to eat anywhere.  Scotti did find one item of possible use under the tumbled remains of a stone hut.  A bow and two arrows made of bone.  The string had been lost, likely burned away in the heat of the fire, but he pulled the cord from Reglius's satchel and restrung it.""},{""text"":""The creatures flew over and hovered nearby as he worked: \""The convent of the sacred Liodes Jurus?\""""},{""text"":""\""You know about the war!  Worms and wine, circumscribe a golden host, apeneck!\""""},{""text"":""The moment the cord was taut, Scotti nocked an arrow and swung around, pulling the string tight against his chest.  The winged beasts, having had experience with archers before, shot off in all directions in a blur.  They needn't have bothered.  Scotti's first arrow dove into the ground three feet in front of him.  He swore and retrieved it.  The mimics, having likewise had experience with poor archers before, returned at once to hovering nearby and mocking Scotti.""},{""text"":""On his second shot, Scotti did much better, in purely technical terms.  He remembered how the archers in Falinesti looked when he pulled himself out from under the hoarvor tick, and they were all taking aim at him.  He extended his left hand, right hand, and right elbow in a symmetrical line, drawing the bow so his hand touched his jawline, and he could see the creature in his sight like the arrow was a finger he was pointing with.  The bolt missed the target by only two feet, but it continued on its trajectory, snapping when it struck a rock wall.""},{""text"":""Scotti walked to the river's edge.  He had only one arrow left, and perhaps, he considered, it would be most practical to find a slow-moving fish and fire it on that.  If he missed, at least there was less of a chance of breaking the shaft, and he could always retrieve it from the water.  A rather torpid, whiskered fish rolled by, and he took aim at it.""},{""text"":""\""My name is Decumus Scotti!\"" one of the creatures howled, frightening the fish away. \""Stupid and a stupid cow!  Will you dance a dance in fire!\""""},{""text"":""Scotti turned and aimed the arrow as he had done before.  This time, however, he remembered to plant his feet as the archers had done, seven inches apart, knees straight, left leg slightly forward to meet the angle of his right shoulder.  He released the last arrow.""},{""text"":""The arrow also proved a serviceable prong for roasting the creature against the smoking hot stones of one of the ruins.  Its other companions had disappeared instantly after the beast was slain, and Scotti was able to dine in peace.  The meat proved to be delicious, if scarcely more than a first course.  He was picking the last of it from the bones, when a boat sailed into view from around the bend of the river.  At the helm were Bosmer sailors.  Scotti ran to the bank and waved his arms.  They averted their eyes and continued past.""},{""text"":""\""You bloody, callous bastards!\"" Scotti howled. \""Knaves!  Hooligans! Apenecks!  Scoundrels!\""""},{""text"":""A gray-whiskered form came out from a hatch, and Scotti immediately recognized him as Gryf Mallon, the poet translator he had met in the caravan from Cyrodiil.""},{""text"":""He peered Scotti's direction, and his eyes lit up with delight, \""Decumus Scotti!  Precisely the man I hoped to see!  I want to get your thoughts on a rather puzzling passage in the Mnoriad Pley Bar!  It begins 'I went weeping into the world, searching for wonders,' perhaps you're familiar with it?\""""},{""text"":""\""I'd like nothing better than to discuss the Mnoriad Pley Bar with you, Gryf!\"" Scotti called back. \""Would you let me come aboard though first?\""""},{""text"":""Overjoyed at being on a ship bound for any port at all, Scotti was true to his word.  For over an hour as the boat rolled down the river past the blackened remnants of Bosmeri villages, he asked no questions and spoke nothing of his life over the past weeks: he merely listened to Mallon's theories of merethic Aldmeri esoterica.  The translator was undemanding of his guest's scholarship, accepting nods and shrugs as civilized conversation.  He even produced some wine and fish jelly, which he shared with Scotti absent-mindedly, as he expounded on his various theses.""},{""text"":""Finally, while Mallon was searching for a reference to some minor point in his notes, Scotti asked, \""Rather off subject, but I was wondering where we're bound.\""""},{""text"":""\""The very heart of the province, Silvenar,\"" Mallon said, not looking up from the passage he was reading. \""It's somewhat bothersome, actually, as I wanted to go to Woodhearth first to talk to a Bosmer there who claims to have an original copy of Dirith Yalmillhiad, if you can believe it.  But for the time being, that has to wait.  Summurset Isle has surrounded the city, and is in the process of starving the citizenry until they surrender.  It's a tiresome prospect, since the Bosmeri are happy to eat one another, so there's a risk that at the end, only one fat wood elf will remain to wave the flag.\""""},{""text"":""\""That is vexing,\"" agreed Scotti, sympathetically. \""To the east, the Khajiiti are burning everything, and to the west, the High Elves are waging war.  I don't suppose the borders to the north are clear?\""""},{""text"":""\""They're even worse,\"" replied Mallon, finger on the page, still distracted. \""The Cyrodiils and Redguards don't want Bosmer refugees streaming into their provinces.  It only stands to reason.  Imagine how much more criminally inclined they'd be now that they're homeless and hungry.\""""},{""text"":""\""So,\"" murmured Scotti, feeling a shiver. \""We're trapped in Valenwood.\""""},{""text"":""\""Not at all.  I need to leave fairly shortly myself, as my publisher has set a very definite deadline for my new book of translations.  From what I understand, one merely petitions to the Silvenar for special border protection and one can cross into Cyrodiil with impunity.\""""},{""text"":""\""Petition the Silvenar, or petition at Silvenar?\""""},{""text"":""\""Petition the Silvenar at Silvenar.  It's an odd nomenclature that is typical of this place, the sort of thing that makes my job as a translator that much more challenging.  The Silvenar, he, or rather they are the closest the Bosmeri have to a great leader.  The essential thing to remember about the Silvenar --\"" Mallon smiled, finding the passage he was looking for, \""Here! 'A fortnight, inexplicable, the world burns into a dance.' There's that metaphor again.\""""},{""text"":""\""What were you saying about the Silvenar?\"" asked Scotti. \""The essential thing to remember?\""""},{""text"":""\""I don't remember what I was saying,\"" replied Mallon, turning back to his oration.""},{""text"":""In a week's time, the little boat bumped along the shallow, calmer waters of the foaming current the Xylo had become, and Decumus Scotti first saw the city of Silvenar.  If Falinesti was a tree, then Silvenar was a flower.  A magnificent pile of faded shades of green, red, blue, and white, shining with crystalline residue.  Mallon had mentioned off-hand, when not otherwise explaining Aldmeri prosody, that Silvenar had once been a blossoming glade in the forest, but owing to some spell or natural cause, the trees' sap began flowing with translucent liqueur.  The process of the sap flowing and hardening over the colorful trees had formed the web of the city.  Mallon's description was intriguing, but it hardly prepared him for the city's beauty.""},{""text"":""\""What is the finest, most luxurious tavern here?\"" Scotti asked one of the Bosmer boatmen.""},{""text"":""\""Prithala Hall,\"" Mallon answered. \""But why don't you stay with me?

His hovel isn't much, but he has the most extraordinary ideas about the principles of a Merethic Aldmeri tribe the Sarmathi --\""""},{""text"":""\""Under any other circumstances, I would happily accept,\"" said Scotti graciously. \""But after weeks of sleeping on the ground or on a raft, and eating whatever I could scrounge, I feel the need for some indulgent creature comforts.  And then, after a day or two, I'll petition the Silvenar for safe passage to Cyrodiil.\""""},{""text"":""The men bade each other goodbye.  Gryf Mallon gave him the address of his publisher in the Imperial City, which Scotti accepted and quickly forgot.  The clerk wandered the streets of Silvenar, crossing bridges of amber, admiring the petrified forest architecture.  In front of a particularly estimable palace of silvery reflective crystal, he found Prithala Hall.""},{""text"":""He took the finest room, and ordered a gluttonous meal of the finest quality.  At a nearby table, he saw two very fat fellows, a man and a Bosmer, remarking how much finer the food was there than at the Silvenar's palace.

All the other sounds and textures of Prithala Hall vanished all around him, as if nothing else existed but the vast form of Jurus. Scotti did not consider himself an emotional man, but he felt a tide flow over him at the sight and sound of the man whose badly written letters had been the guideposts that carried him from the Imperial City back in early Frost Fall.""},{""text"":""\""Where have you been?\"" Jurus demanded again. \""I told you to meet me in Falinesti weeks ago.\""""},{""text"":""\""I was there weeks ago,\"" Scotti stammered, too surprised to be indignant. \""I got your note to meet you in Athay, and so I went there, but the Khajiiti had burned it to the ground.

The clerk nodded to Basth coldly, still numb and confused.  It had not left his mind that only any hour earlier, Scotti had intended to petition the Silvenar for safe passage through the border back to Cyrodiil.  The thought of doing business with Jurus after all, of profiting from Valenwood war with Elsweyr, and now the second one with the Summurset Isle, seemed like something happening to another person.""},{""text"":""\""Your colleague and I were talking about the Silvenar,\"" said Basth, putting down the leg of mutton he had been gnawing on. \""I don't suppose you've heard about his nature?\""""},{""text"":""\""A little, but nothing very specific.

When they're mostly female, so is he.  When they cry for food or trade or an absence of foreign interference, he feels it too, and makes laws accordingly.  In a way, he's a despot, but he's the people's despot.\""""},{""text"":""\""That sounds,\"" said Scotti, searching for the appropriate word. \""Like ... bunk.\""""},{""text"":""\""Perhaps it is,\"" shrugged Basth. \""But he has many rights as the Voice of the People, including the granting of foreign building and trade contracts.  It's not important whether you believe us.  Just think of the Silvenar as being like one of your mad Emperors, like Pelagius.  The problem facing us now is that since Valenwood is being attacked on all sides, the Silvenar's aspect is now one of distrust and fear of foreigners.  The one hope of his people, and thus of the Silvenar himself, is that the Emperor will intervene and stop the war.\""""},{""text"":""\""Will he?\"" asked Scotti.""},{""text"":""\""You know as well as we do that the Emperor has not been himself lately,\"" Jurus helped himself to Reglius's satchel and pulled out the blank contracts. \""Who knows what he'll choose to do or not do?

Scotti ate continuously, but not nearly so much as Jurus and Basth.  When the sun had begun to rise in the hills, its light reddening through the crystal walls of the tavern, Jurus and Basth left to their rooms at the palace, granted to them diplomatically in lieu of an actual immediate audience with the Silvenar.  Scotti went to his room.  He thought about staying up a little longer to ruminate over Jurus's plans and see what might be the flaw in them, but upon touching the cool, soft bed, he immediately fell asleep.""},{""text"":""The next afternoon, Scotti awoke, feeling himself again.  In other words, timid.  For several weeks now, he had been a creature bent on mere survival.  He had been driven to exhaustion, attacked by several jungle beasts, starved, nearly drowned, and forced into discussions of ancient Aldmeri poetical works.  The discussion he had with Jurus and Basth about how to dupe the Silvenar into signing their contracts seemed perfectly reasonable then.  Scotti dressed himself in his old battered clothes and went downstairs in search of food and a peaceful place to think.""},{""text"":""\""You're up,\"" cried Basth upon seeing him. \""We should go to the palace now.\""""},{""text"":""\""Now?\"" whined Scotti. \""Look at me.

I haven't even bathed.\""""},{""text"":""\""You must cease from this moment forward being a clerk, and become a student of mercantile trade,\"" said Liodes Jurus grandly, taking Scotti by the arm and leading him into the sunlit boulevard outside. \""The first rule is to recognize what you represent to the prospective client, and what angle best suits you.  You cannot dazzle him with opulent fashion and professional bearing, my dear boy, and it would be fatal if you attempted to.   Trust me on this.  Several others besides Basth and I are guests at the palace, and they have made the error of appearing too eager, too formal, too ready for business.  They will never be granted audience with the Silvenar, but we have remained aloof ever since the initial rejection.  I've dallied about the court, spread my knowledge of life in the Imperial City, had my ears pierced, attended promenades, eaten and drunk of all that was given to me.  I dare say I've put on a pound or two.  The message we've sent is clear: it is in his, not our, best interest to meet.\""""},{""text"":""\""Our plan worked,\"" added Basth. \""When I told his minister that our Imperial representative had arrived, and that we were at last willing to meet with the Silvenar this morning, we were told to bring you there straightaway.\""""},{""text"":""\""Aren't we late then?\"" asked Scotti.""},{""text"":""\""Very,\"" laughed Jurus. \""But that's again part of the angle we're representing.  Benevolent disinterest.  Remember not to confuse the Silvenar with conventional nobility.  His is the mind of the common people.  When you grasp that, you'll understand how to manipulate him.\""""},{""text"":""Jurus spent the last several minutes of the walk through the city expounding on his theories about what Valenwood needed, how much, and at what price.  They were staggering figures, far more construction and far higher costs than anything Scotti had been used to dealing with.  He listened carefully.  All around them, the city of Silvenar revealed itself, glass and flower, roaring winds and beautiful inertia.  When they reached the palace of the Silvenar, Decumus Scotti stopped, stunned.  Jurus looked at him for a moment and then laughed.""},{""text"":""\""It's quite bizarre, isn't it?\""""},{""text"":""That it was.  A frozen scarlet burst of twisted, uneven spires as if a rival sun rising.  A blossom the size of a village, where courtiers and servants resembled nothing so much as insects walked about it sucking its ichor.  Entering over a bent petal-like bridge, the three walked through the palace of unbalanced walls.  Where the partitions bent close together and touched, there was a shaded hall or a small chamber.  Where they warped away from one another, there was a courtyard.  There were no doors anywhere, no any way to get to the Silvenar but by crossing through the entire spiral of the palace, through meetings and bedrooms and dining halls, past dignitaries, consorts, musicians, and many guards.""},{""text"":""\""It's an interesting place,\"" said Basth. \""But not very much privacy.  Of course, that suits the Silvenar well.\""""},{""text"":""When they reached the inner corridors, two hours after they first entered the palace, guards, brandishing blades and bows, stopped them.""},{""text"":""\""We have an audience with the Silvenar,\"" said Jurus, patiently. \""This is Lord Decumus Scotti, the Imperial representative.\""""},{""text"":""One of the guards disappeared down the winding corridor, and returned moments later with a tall, proud Bosmer clad in a loose robe of patchwork leather.  He was the Minister of Trade: \""The Silvenar wishes to speak with Lord Decumus Scotti alone.\""""},{""text"":""It was not the place to argue or show fear, so Scotti stepped forward, not even looking toward Jurus and Basth.  He was certain they were showing their masks of benevolent indifference.  Following the Minister into the audience chamber, Scotti recited to himself all the facts and figures Jurus had presented to him.  He willed himself to remember the Angle and the Image he must project.""},{""text"":""The audience chamber of the Silvenar was an enormous dome where the walls bent from bowl-shaped at the base inward to almost meet at the top.  A thin ray of sunlight streamed through the fissure hundreds of feet above, and directly upon the Silvenar, who stood upon a puff of shimmering gray powder.  For all the wonder of the city and the palace, the Silvenar himself looked perfectly ordinary.  An average, blandly handsome, slightly tired-looking, extra-ordinary Wood Elf of the type one might see in any capitol in the Empire.  It was only when he stepped from the dais that Scotti noticed an eccentricity in his appearance.  He was very short.""},{""text"":""\""I had to speak with you alone,\"" said the Silvenar in a voice common and unrefined. \""May I see your papers?\""""},{""text"":""Scotti handed him the blank contracts from Lord Vanech's Building Commission.  The Silvenar studied them, running his finger over the embossed seal of the Emperor, before handing them back.  He suddenly seemed shy, looking to the floor.  \""There are many charlatans at my court who wish to benefit from the wars.  I thought you and your colleagues were among them, but those contracts are genuine.\""""},{""text"":""\""Yes, they are,\"" said Scotti calmly.  The Silvenar's conventional aspect made it easy for Scotti to speak, with no formal greetings, no deference, exactly as Jurus had instructed: \""It seems most sensible to begin straightaway talking about the roads which need to be rebuilt, and then the harbors that the Altmeri have destroyed, and then I can give you my estimates on the cost of resupplying and renovating the trade routes.\""""},{""text"":""\""Why hasn't the Emperor seen fit to send a representative when the war with Elsweyr began, two years ago?\"" asked the Silvenar glumly.""},{""text"":""Scotti thought a moment before replying of all the common Bosmeri he had met in Valenwood.  The greedy, frightened mercenaries who had escorted him from the border.  The hard-drinking revelers and expert pest exterminating archers in the Western Cross of Falinesti.  Nosy old Mother Pascost in Havel Slump.  Captain Balfix, the poor sadly reformed pirate.  The terrified but hopeful refugees of Athay and Grenos.  The mad, murderous, self-devouring Wild Hunt of Vindisi.  The silent, dour boatmen hired by Gryf Mallon.  The degenerate, grasping Basth.  If one creature represented their total disposition, and that of many more throughout the province,  what would be his personality?  Scotti was a clerk by occupation and nature, instinctively comfortable cataloging and filing, making things fit in a system.  If the soul of Valenwood were to be filed, where would it be put?""},{""text"":""The answer came upon him almost before he posed himself the question.  Denial.""},{""text"":""\""I'm afraid that question doesn't interest me,\"" said Scotti. \""Now, can we get back to the business at hand?\""""},{""text"":""All afternoon, Scotti and the Silvenar discussed the pressing needs of Valenwood.  Every contract was filled and signed.  So much was required and there were so many costs associated that addendums and codicils had to be scribbled into the margins of the papers, and those had to be resigned.  Scotti maintained his benevolent indifference, but he found that dealing with the Silvenar was not quite the same as dealing with a simple, sullen child.  The Voice of the People knew certain practical, everyday things very well: the yields of fish, the benefits of trade, the condition of every township and forest in his province.""},{""text"":""\""We will have a banquet tomorrow night to celebrate this commission,\"" said the Silvenar at last.""},{""text"":""\""Best make it tonight,\"" replied Scotti. \""We should leave for Cyrodiil with the contracts tomorrow, so I'll need a safe passage to the border.  We best not waste any more time.\""""},{""text"":""\""Agreed,\"" said the Silvenar, and called for his Minister of Trade to put his seal on the contracts and arrange for the feast.""},{""text"":""Scotti left the chamber, and was greeted by Basth and Jurus.  Their faces showed the strain of maintaining the illusion of unconcern for too many hours.  As soon as they were out of sight of the guards, they begged Scotti to tell them all.  When he showed them the contract, Basth began weeping with delight.""},{""text"":""\""Anything about the Silvenar that surprised you?\"" asked Jurus.""},{""text"":""\""I hadn't expected him to be half my height.\""""},{""text"":""\""Was he?\"" Jurus looked mildly surprised. \""He must have shrunk since I tried to have an audience with him earlier.

They looked on Decumus Scotti, Liodes Jurus, and Basth with undisguised hatred.  It made Scotti very uncomfortable, but Jurus delighted in it.  As the servants brought in platter after platter of roasted meats, Jurus poured himself a cup of Jagga and toasted the clerk.""},{""text"":""\""I can confess it now,\"" said Jurus. \""I had grave doubts about inviting you to join me on this adventure.  All the other clerks and agents of building commissions I contacted were more outwardly aggressive, but none of them made it through, let alone to the audience chamber of the Silvenar, let alone brokered the deals on their own like you did.  Come, have a cup of Jagga with me.\""""},{""text"":""\""No thank you,\"" said Scotti. \""I had too much of that drug in Falinesti, and nearly got sucked dry by a giant tick because of it.  I'll find something else to drink.\""""},{""text"":""Scotti wandered about the hall until he saw some diplomats drinking mugs of a steaming brown liquid, poured from a large silver urn.  He asked them if it was tea.""},{""text"":""\""Tea made from leaves?\"" scoffed the first diplomat. \""Not in Valenwood.  This is Rotmeth.\""""},{""text"":""Scotti poured himself a mug and took a tentative sip.  It was gamy, bitter and sugared, and very salty.  At first it seemed very disagreeable to his palate, but a moment later he found he had drained the mug and was pouring another.  His body tingled.  All the sounds in the chamber seemed oddly disjointed, but not frighteningly so.""},{""text"":""\""So you're the fellow who got the Silvenar to sign all those contracts,\"" said the second diplomat. \""That must have required some deep negotiation.\""""},{""text"":""\""Not at all, not at all, just a little basic understand of mercantile trading,\"" grinned Scotti, pouring himself a third mug of Rotmeth. \""The Silvenar was very eager to involve the Imperial state with the affairs of Valenwood.  I was very eager to take a percentage of the commission.  With all that blessed eagerness, it was merely a matter of putting quill to contract, bless you.\""""},{""text"":""\""You have been in the employ of his Imperial Majesty very long?\"" asked the first diplomat.""},{""text"":""\""It's a bite, or rather, a bit more complicated than that in the Imperial City.

I can go to my old employer and to Lord Vanech, and say, look here you, which one of you wants these commissions?  And they'll fall over each other to take them from me.  It will be bidding war for my percentage the likes of which no one nowhere has never seen.\""""},{""text"":""\""So you're not a representative of his Imperial Majesty, the Emperor?\"" asked the first diplomat.""},{""text"":""\""Didn't you hear what I'm said? You stupid?\"" Scotti felt a surge of rage, which quickly subsided.  He chuckled, and poured himself a seventh mug. \""The Building Commissions are privately owned, but they're still representatives of the Emperor.  So I'm a representative of the Emperor.  Or I will be.  When I get these contracts in.  It's very complicated.  I can understand why you're not following me.  Bless you, it's all like the poet said, a dance in fire, if you follow the illusion, that is to say, allusion.\""""},{""text"":""\""And your colleagues?  Are they representatives of the Emperor?\"" asked the second diplomat.""},{""text"":""Scotti burst into laughter, shaking his head.  The diplomats bade him their respects and went to talk to the Minister.  Scotti stumbled out of the palace, and reeled through the strange, organic avenues and boulevards of the city.  It took him several hours to find his way to Prithala Hall and his room.  Once there, he slept, very nearly on his bed.""},{""text"":""The next morning, he woke to Jurus and Basth in his room, shaking him.  He felt half-asleep and unable to open his eyes fully, but otherwise fine.  The conversation with the diplomats floated in his mind in a haze, like an obscure childhood memory.""},{""text"":""\""What in Mara's name is Rotmeth?\"" he asked quickly.""},{""text"":""\""Rancid, strongly fermented meat juices with lots of spices to kill the poisons,\"" smiled Basth. \""I should have warned you to stay with Jagga.\""""},{""text"":""\""You must understand the Meat Mandate by now,\"" laughed Jurus. \""These Bosmeri would rather eat each other than touch the fruit of the vine or the field.\""""},{""text"":""\""What did I say to those diplomats?\"" cried Scotti, panicking.""},{""text"":""\""Nothing bad apparently,\"" said Jurus, pulling out some papers. \""Your escorts are downstairs to bring you to the Imperial Province.  Here are your papers of safe passage.  The Silvenar seems very impatient about business proceeding forward rapidly.  He promises to send you some sort of rare treasure when the contracts are fulfilled.  See, he's already given me something.\""""},{""text"":""Jurus showed off his new, bejeweled earring, a beautiful large faceted ruby.  Basth showed that he had a similar one.  The two fat fellows left the room so Scotti could dress and pack.""},{""text"":""A full regiment of the Silvenar's guards was on the street in front of the tavern.  They surrounded a carriage crested with the official arms of Valenwood.  Still dazed, Scotti climbed in, and the captain of the guard gave the signal.  They began a quick gallop.  Scotti shook himself, and then peered behind.  Basth and Jurus were waving him goodbye.""},{""text"":""\""Wait!\"" Scotti cried. \""Aren't you coming back to the Imperial Province too?\""""},{""text"":""\""The Silvenar asked that we stay behind as Imperial representatives!\"" yelled Liodes Jurus. \""In case there's a need for more contracts and negotiations!  He's appointed us Undrape, some sort of special honor for foreigners at court!  Don't worry!  Lots of banquets to attend!  You can handle the negotiations with Vanech and Atrius yourself and we'll keep things settled here!\""""},{""text"":""Jurus continued to yell advice about business, but his voice became indistinct with distance.  Soon it disappeared altogether as the convoy rounded the streets of Silvenar.  The jungle loomed suddenly and then they were in it.  Scotti had only gone through it by foot or along the rivers by slow-moving boats.  Now it flashed all around him in profusions of greens.  The horses seemed even faster moving through underbrush than on the smooth paths of the city.  None of the weird sounds or dank smells of the jungle penetrated the escort.  It felt to Scotti as if he were watching a play about the jungle with a background of a quickly moving scrim, which offered only the merest suggestion of the place.""},{""text"":""So it went for two weeks.  There was lots of food and water in the carriage with the clerk, so he merely ate and slept as the caravan pressed endlessly on.  From time to time, he'd hear the sound of blades clashing, but when he looked around whatever had attacked the caravan had long since been left behind.  At last, they reached the border, where an Imperial garrison was stationed.""},{""text"":""Scotti presented the soldiers who met the carriage with the papers.  They asked him a barrage of questions that he answered monosyllabically, and then let him pass.  It took several more days to arrive at the gates of the Imperial City.  The horses that had flown so fast through the jungle now slowed down in the unfamiliar territory of the wooded Colovian Estates.  By contrast, the cries of his province's birds and smells of his province's plant life brought Decumus Scotti alive.  It was if he had been dreaming all the past months.""},{""text"":""At the gates of the City, Scotti's carriage door was opened for him and he stepped out on uncertain legs.  Before he had a moment to say something to the escort, they had vanished, galloping back south through the forest.  The first thing he did now that he was home was go to the closest tavern and have tea and fruit and bread.  If he never ate meat again, he told himself, that would suit him very nicely.""},{""text"":""Negotiations with Lord Atrius and Lord Vanech proceeded immediately thereafter.  It was most agreeable.  Both commissions recognized how lucrative the rebuilding of Valenwood would be for their agency.  Lord Vanech claimed, quite justifiably, that as the contracts had been written on forms notarized by his commission, he had the legal right to them.  Lord Atrius claimed that Decumus Scotti was his agent and representative, and that he had never been released from employment.  The Emperor was called to arbitrate, but he claimed to be unavailable.  His advisor, the Imperial Battlemage Jagar Tharn, had disappeared long ago and could not be called on for his wisdom and impartial mediation.""},{""text"":""Scotti lived very comfortably off the bribes from Lord Atrius and Lord Vanech.  Every week, a letter would arrive from Jurus or Basth asking about the status of negotiations.  Gradually, these letters ceased coming, and more urgent ones came from the Minister of Trade and the Silvenar himself.  The War of the Blue Divide with Summurset Isle ended with the Altmeri winning several new coastal islands from the Wood Elves.  The war with Elsweyr continued, ravaging the eastern borders of Valenwood.  Still, Vanech and Atrius fought over who would help.""},{""text"":""One fine morning in the early spring of the year 3E 398, a courier arrived at Decumus Scotti's door.""},{""text"":""\""Lord Vanech has won the Valenwood commission, and requests that you and the contracts come to his hall at your earliest convenience.\""""},{""text"":""\""Has Lord Atrius decided not to challenge further?\"" asked Scotti.""},{""text"":""\""He's been unable to, having died very suddenly, just now, from a terribly unfortunate accident,\"" said the courier.""},{""text"":""Scotti had wondered how long it would be before the Dark Brotherhood was brought in for final negotiations.  As he walked toward Lord Vanech's Building Commission, a long, severe piece of architecture on a minor but respectable plaza, he wondered if he had played the game, as he ought to have.  Could Vanech be so rapacious as to offer him a lower percentage of the commission now that his chief competitor was dead?  Thankfully, he discovered, Lord Vanech had already decided to pay Scotti what he had proposed during the heat of the winter negotiations.  His advisors had explained to him that other, lesser building commissions might come forward unless the matter were handled quickly and fairly.""},{""text"":""\""Glad we have all the legal issues done with,\"" said Lord Vanech, fondly. \""Now we can get to the business of helping the poor Bosmeri, and collecting the profits.

But there will be plenty more wars, I'm sure of that.\""""},{""text"":""Scotti and Lord Vanech sent word to the Silvenar that at last they were prepared to honor the contracts.  A few weeks later, they held a banquet in honor of the profitable enterprise.  Decumus Scotti was the darling of the Imperial City, and no expense was spared to make it an unforgettable evening.""},{""text"":""As Scotti met the nobles and wealthy merchants who would be benefiting from his business dealings, an exotic but somehow faintly familiar smell rose in the ballroom.  He traced it to its source: a thick roasted slab of meat, so long and thick it covered several platters.

Suddenly they plummeted from the heights.""},{""text1"":""\""Mara!\"" cried Scotti. \""They're falling like rain!\""""},{""text1"":""\""Probably seed pods,\"" Mallon shrugged, not turning around. \""Some of the trees have remarkable --\""""},{""text1"":""The camp erupted into chaos.  Fires burst out in the wagons, the horses wailed from mortal blows, casks of wine, fresh water, and liquor gushed their contents to the ground.  A nimble shadow dashed past Scotti and Mallon, gathering sacks of grain and gold with impossible agility and grace.  Scotti had only one glance at it, lit up by a sudden nearby burst of flame.  It was a sleek creature with pointed ears, wide yellow eyes, mottled pied fur and a tail like a whip.""},{""text1"":""\""Werewolf,\"" he whimpered, shrinking back.""},{""text1"":""\""Cathay-raht,\"" groaned Mallon. \""Much worse.  Khajiti cousins or some such thing, come to plunder.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Are you sure?\""""},{""text1"":""As quickly as they struck, the creatures retreated, diving off the bluff before the battlemage and knight, the caravan's escorts, had fully opened their eyes.  Mallon and Scotti ran to the precipice and saw a hundred feet below the tiny figures dash out of the water, shake themselves, and disappear into the wood.""},{""text1"":""\n\""Werewolves aren't acrobats like that,\"" said Mallon. \""They were definitely Cathay-raht.  Bastard thieves.  Thank Stendarr they didn't realize the value of my notebooks.

The Cathay-Raht had stolen or destroyed almost every item of value in the caravan in just a few minutes' time. Decumus Scotti's wagonload of wood he had hoped to trade with the Bosmer had been set on fire and then toppled off the bluff.  His clothing and contracts were tattered and ground into the mud of dirt mixed with spilt wine. All the pilgrims, merchants, and adventurers in the group moaned and wept as they gathered the remnants of their belongings by the rising sun of the dawn.""},{""text1"":""\""I best not tell anyone that I managed to hold onto my notes for my translation of the Mnoriad Pley Bar,\"" whispered the poet Gryf Mallon.\""They'd probably turn on me.\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti politely declined the opportunity of telling Mallon just how little value he himself placed on the man's property. Instead, he counted the coins in his purse.  Thirty-four gold pieces. Very little indeed for an entrepreneur beginning a new business.""},{""text1"":""\""Hoy!\"" came a cry from the wood. A small party of Bosmer emerged from the thicket, clad in leather mail and bearing arms. \""Friend or foe?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Neither,\"" growled the convoy head.""},{""text1"":""\""You must be the Cyrodiils,\"" laughed the leader of the group, a tall skeleton-thin youth with a sharp vulpine face. \""We heard you were en route. Evidently, so did our enemies.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I thought the war was over,\"" muttered one of the caravan's now ruined merchants.""},{""text1"":""The Bosmer laughed again: \""No act of war. Just a little border enterprise. You are going on to Falinesti?\""""},{""text1"":""\""I'm not,\"" the convoy head shook his head. \""As far as I'm concerned, my duty is done. No more horses, no more caravan. Just a fat profit loss to me.\""""},{""text1"":""The men and women crowded around the man, protesting, threatening, begging, but he refused to step foot in Valenwood. If these were the new times of peace, he said, he'd rather come back for the next war.""},{""text1"":""Scotti tried a different route and approached the Bosmer. He spoke with an authoritative but friendly voice, the kind he used in negotiations with peevish carpenters: \""I don't suppose you'd consider escorting me to Falinesti. I'm a representative for an important Imperial agency, the Atrius Building Commission, here to help repair and alleviate some of the problems the war with the Khajiit brought to your province.  Patriotism --\""""},{""text1"":""\""Twenty gold pieces, and you must carry your own gear if you have any left,\"" replied the Bosmer.""},{""text1"":""Scotti reflected that negotiations with peevish carpenters rarely went his way either.""},{""text1"":""Six eager people had enough gold on them for payment. Among those without funds was the poet, who appealed to Scotti for assistance.""},{""text1"":""\""I'm sorry, Gryf, I only have fourteen gold left over. Not even enough for a decent room when I get to Falinesti. I really would help you if I could,\"" said Scotti, persuading himself that it was true.""},{""text1"":""The band of six and their Bosmer escorts began the descent down a rocky path along the bluff. Within an hour's time, they were deep in the jungles of Valenwood.  A never-ending canopy of hues of browns and greens obscured the sky. A millennia's worth of fallen leaves formed a deep, wormy sea of putrefaction beneath their feet. Several miles were crossed wading through the slime.  For several more, they took a labyrinthian path across fallen branches and the low-hanging boughs of giant trees.""},{""text1"":""All the while, hour after hour, the inexhaustible Bosmer host moved so fast, the Cyrodiils struggled to keep from being left behind. A red-faced little merchant with short legs took a bad step on a rotten branch and nearly fell. His fellow provincials had to help him up. The Bosmer paused only a moment, their eyes continually darting to the shadows in the trees above before moving on at their usual expeditious pace.""},{""text1"":""\""What are they so nervous about?\"" wheezed the merchant irritably. \""More Cathay-Raht?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Don't be ridiculous,\"" laughed the Bosmer unconvincingly. \""Khajiit this far into Valenwood? In times of peace? They'd never dare.\""""},{""text1"":""When the group passed high enough above the swamp that the smell was somewhat dissipated, Scotti felt a sudden pang of hunger. He was used to four meals a day in the Cyrodilic custom. Hours of nonstop exertion without food was not part of his regimen as a comfortably paid clerk. He pondered, feeling somewhat delirious, how long they had been trotting through the jungle. Twelve hours?  Twenty? A week? Time was meaningless. Sunlight was only sporadic through the vegetative ceiling. Phosphorescent molds on the trees and in the muck below provided the only regular illumination.""},{""text1"":""\""Is it at all possible for us to rest and eat?\"" he hollered to his host up ahead.""},{""text1"":""\""We're near to Falinesti,\"" came the echoing reply. \""Lots of food there.\""""},{""text1"":""The path continued upward for several hours more across a clot of fallen logs, rising up to the first and then the second boughs of the tree line. As they rounded a long corner, the travelers found themselves midway up a waterfall that fell a hundred feet or more. No one had the energy to complain as they began pulling up the stacks of rock, agonizing foot by foot. The Bosmer escorts disappeared into the mist, but Scotti kept climbing until there was no more rock left. He wiped the sweat and river water from his eyes.""},{""text1"":""Falinesti spread across the horizon before him. Sprawling across both banks of the river stood the mighty graht-oak city, with groves and orchards of lesser trees crowding it like supplicants before their king. At a lesser scale, the tree that formed the moving city would have been extraordinary: gnarled and twisted with a gorgeous crown of gold and green, dripping with vines and shining with sap. At a mile tall and half as wide, it was the most magnificent thing Scotti had ever seen. If he had not been a starving man with the soul of a clerk, he would have sung.""},{""text1"":""\""There you are,\"" said the leader of the escorts. \""Not too far a walk. You should be glad it's wintertide. In summertide, the city's on the far south end of the province.\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti was lost as to how to proceed. The sight of the vertical metropolis where people moved about like ants disoriented all his sensibilities.""},{""text1"":""\""You wouldn't know of an inn called,\"" he paused for a moment, and then pulled Jurus's letter from his pocket. \""Something like 'Mother Paskos Tavern'?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Mother Pascost?\"" the lead Bosmer laughed his familiar contemptuous laugh. \""You won't want to stay there? Visitors always prefer the Aysia Hall in the top boughs.  It's expensive, but very nice.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I'm meeting someone at Mother Pascost's Tavern.\""""},{""text1"":""\""If you've made up your mind to go, take a lift to Havel Slump and ask for directions there. Just don't get lost and fall asleep in the western cross.\""""},{""text1"":""This apparently struck the youth's friends as a very witty jest, and so it was with their laughter echoing behind him that Scotti crossed the writhing root system to the base of Falinesti. The ground was littered with leaves and refuse, and from moment to moment a glass or a bone would plummet from far above, so he walked with his neck crooked to have warning. An intricate network of platforms anchored to thick vines slipped up and down the slick trunk of the city with perfect grace, manned by operators with arms as thick as an ox's belly. Scotti approaches the nearest fellow at one of the platforms, who was idly smoking from a glass pipe.""},{""text1"":""\""I was wondering if you might take me to Havel Slump.\""""},{""text1"":""The mer nodded and within a few minutes time, Scotti was two hundred feet in the air at a crook between two mighty branches. Curled webs of moss stretched unevenly across the fork, forming a sharing roof for several dozen small buildings.  There were only a few souls in the alley, but around the bend ahead, he could hear the sound of music and people. Scotti tipped the Falinesti Platform Ferryman a gold piece and asked for the location of Mother Pascost's Tavern.""},{""text1"":""\""Straight ahead of you, sir, but you won't find anyone there,\"" the Ferryman explained, pointing in the direction of the noise. \""Morndas everyone in Havel Slump has revelry.\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti walked carefully along the narrow street. Though the ground felt as solid as the marble avenues of the Imperial City, there were slick cracks in the bark that exposed fatal drops into the river. He took a moment to sit down, to rest and get used to the view from the heights. It was a beautiful day for certain, but it took Scotti only a few minutes of contemplation to rise up in alarm. A jolly little raft anchored down stream below him had distinctly moved several inches while he watched it.  But it hadn't moved at all. He had. Together with everything around him. It was no metaphor: the city of Falinesti walked. And, considering its size, it moved quickly.""},{""text1"":""Scotti rose to his feet and into a cloud of smoke that drifted out from around the bend. It was the most delicious roast he had ever smelled. The clerk forgot his fear and ran.""},{""text1"":""The \""revelry\"" as the Ferryman had termed it took place on an enormous platform tied to the tree, wide enough to be a plaza in any other city. A fantastic assortment of the most amazing people Scotti had ever seen were jammed shoulder-to-shoulder together, many eating, many more drinking, and some dancing to a lutist and singer perched on an offshoot above the crowd.  They were largely Bosmer, true natives clad in colorful leather and bones, with a close minority of orcs.  Whirling through the throng, dancing and bellowing at one another were a hideous ape people. A few heads bobbing over the tops of the crowd belonged not, as Scotti first assumed, to very tall people, but to a family of centaurs.""},{""text1"":""\""Care for some mutton?\"" queried a wizened old mer who roasted an enormous beast on some red-hot rocks.""},{""text1"":""Scotti quickly paid him a gold piece and devoured the leg he was given.  And then another gold piece and another leg. The fellow chuckled when Scotti began choking on a piece of gristle, and handed him a mug of a frothing white drink. He drank it and felt a quiver run through his body as if he were being tickled.""},{""text1"":""\""What is that?\"" Scotti asked.""},{""text1"":""\""Jagga. Fermented pig's milk. I can let you have a flagon of it and a bit more mutton for another gold.\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti agreed, paid, gobbled down the meat, and took the flagon with him as he slipped into the crowd.  His co-worker Liodes Jurus, the man who had told him to come to Valenwood, was nowhere to be seen. When the flagon was a quarter empty, Scotti stopped looking for Jurus.  When it was half empty, he was dancing with the group, oblivious to the broken planks and gaps in the fencework.  At three quarters empty, he was trading jokes with a group of creatures whose language was completely alien to him. By the time the flagon was completely drained, he was asleep, snoring, while the revelry continued on all around his supine body.""},{""text1"":""The next morning, still asleep, Scotti had the sensation of someone kissing him.  He made a face to return the favor, but a pain like fire spread through his chest and forced him to open his eyes. There was an insect the size of a large calf sitting on him, crushing him, its spiky legs holding him down while a central spiral-bladed vortex of a mouth tore through his shirt. He screamed and thrashed but the beast was too strong. It had found its meal and it was going to finish it.""},{""text1"":""It's over, thought Scotti wildly, I should have never left home. I could have stayed in the City, and perhaps found work with Lord Vanech. I could have begun again as a junior clerk and worked my way back up.""},{""text1"":""Suddenly the mouth released itself. The creature shivered once, expelled a burst of yellow bile, and died.""},{""text1"":""\""Got one!\"" cried a voice, not too distantly.""},{""text1"":""For a moment, Scotti lay still. His head throbbed and his chest burned. Out of the corner of his eye he saw movement. Another of the horrible monsters was scurried towards him. He scrambled, trying to push himself free, but before he could come out, there was a sound of a bow cracking and an arrow pierced the second insect.""},{""text1"":""\""Good shot!\"" cried another voice. \""Get the first one again! I just saw it move a little!\""""},{""text1"":""This time, Scotti felt the impact of the bolt hit the carcass. He cried out, but he could hear how muffled his voice was by the beetle's body. Cautiously, he tried sliding a foot out and rolling under, but the movement apparently had the effect of convincing the archers that the creature still lived. A volley of arrows was launched forth. Now the beast was sufficiently perforated so pools of its blood, and likely the blood of its victims, began to seep out onto Scotti's body.""},{""text1"":""When Scotti was a lad, before he grew too sophisticated for such sports, he had often gone to the Imperial Arena for the competitions of war. He recalled a great veteran of the fights, when asked, telling him his secret, \""Whenever I'm in doubt of what to do, and I have a shield, I stay behind it.\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti followed that advice. After an hour, when he no longer heard arrows being fired, he threw aside the remains of the bug and leapt as quickly as he could to a stand. It was not a moment too soon. A gang of eight archers had their bows pointing his direction, ready to fire. When they saw him, they laughed.""},{""text1"":""\""Didn't anyone ever tell you not to sleep in the western cross? How're we going to exterminate all the hoarvors if you drunks keep feeding 'em?\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti shook his head and walked back along the platform, round the bend, to Havel Slump. He was bloodied and torn and tired and he had far too much fermented pig's milk. All he wanted was a proper place to lie down. He stepped into Mother Pascost's Tavern, a dank place, wet with sap, smelling of mildew.""},{""text1"":""\""My name is Decumus Scotti,\"" he said. \""I was hoping you have someone named Jurus staying here.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Decumus Scotti?\"" pondered the fleshy proprietress, Mother Pascost herself. \""I've heard that name. Oh, you must be the fellow he left the note for. Let me go see if I can find it.\""""},{""text1"":""A Dance in Fire\nChapter 3""},{""text1"":""by\nWaughin Jarth""},{""text1"":""Mother Pascost disappeared into the sordid hole that was her tavern, and emerged a moment later with a scrap of paper with Liodes Jurus's familiar scrawl.  Decumus Scotti held it up before a patch of sunlight that had found its way through the massive boughs of the tree city, and read.""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""Sckotti,\nSo you made it to Falinnesti, Vallinwood!

Meat me down here as son as you can.\nJurus""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""So, Scotti pondered, Jurus had left Falinesti and gone to some place called Athie.  Given his poor penmanship and ghastly spelling, it could equally well be Athy, Aphy, Othry, Imthri, Urtha, or Krakamaka.  The sensible thing to do, Scotti knew, was to call this adventure over and try to find some way to get back home to the Imperial City.  He was no mercenary devoted to a life of thrills: he was, or at least had been, a senior clerk at a successful private building commission.  Over the last few weeks, he had been robbed by the Cathay-Raht, taken on a death march through the jungle by a gang of giggling Bosmeri, half-starved to death, drugged with fermented pig's milk, nearly slain by some kind of giant tick, and attacked by archers.  He was filthy, exhausted, and had, he counted, ten gold pieces to his name.  Now the man whose proposal brought him to the depths of misery was not even there.  It was both judicious and seemly to abandon the enterprise entirely.""},{""text1"":""And yet, a small but distinct voice in his head told him: You have been chosen.  You have no other choice but to see this through.""},{""text1"":""Scotti turned to the stout old woman, Mother Pascost, who had been watching him curiously: \""I was wondering if you knew of a village that was at the edge of the recent conflict with Elsweyr.  It's called something like Ath-ie?\""""},{""text1"":""\""You must mean Athay,\"" she grinned. \""My middle lad, Viglil, he manages a dairy down there.  Beautiful country, right on the river.  Is that where your friend went?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Yes,\"" said Scotti. \""Do you know the fastest way to get there?\""""},{""text1"":""After a short conversation, an even shorter ride to Falinesti's roots by way of the platforms, and a jog to the river bank, Scotti was negotiating transport with a huge fair-haired Bosmer with a face like a pickled carp.  He called himself Captain Balfix, but even Scotti with his sheltered life could recognize him for what he was.  A retired pirate for hire, a smuggler for certain, and probably much worse.  His ship, which had clearly been stolen in the distant past, was a bent old Imperial sloop.""},{""text1"":""\""Fifty gold and we'll be in Athay in two days time,\"" boomed Captain Balfix expansively.""},{""text1"":""\""I have ten, no, sorry, nine gold pieces,\"" replied Scotti, and feeling the need for explanation, added, \""I had ten, but I gave one to the Platform Ferryman to get me down here.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Nine is just as fine,\"" said the captain agreeably. \""Truth be told, I was going to Athay whether you paid me or not.  Make yourself comfortable on the boat, we'll be leaving in just a few minutes.\""""},{""text1"":""Decumus Scotti boarded the vessel, which sat low in the water of the river, stacked high with crates and sacks that spilled out of the hold and galley and onto the deck.  Each was marked with stamps advertising the most innocuous substances: copper scraps, lard, ink, High Rock meal (marked \""For Cattle\""), tar, fish jelly.  Scotti's imagination reeled picturing what sorts of illicit imports were truly aboard.""},{""text1"":""It took more than those few minutes for Captain Balfix to haul in the rest of his cargo, but in an hour, the anchor was up and they were sailing downriver towards Athay.  The green gray water barely rippled, only touched by the fingers of the breeze.  Lush plant life crowded the banks, obscuring from sight all the animals that sang and roared at one another.  Lulled by the serene surroundings, Scotti drifted to sleep.""},{""text1"":""At night, he awoke and gratefully accepted some clean clothes and food from Captain Balfix.""},{""text1"":""\""Why are you going to Athay, if I may ask?\"" queried the Bosmer.""},{""text1"":""\""I'm meeting a former colleague there.  He asked me to come down from the Imperial City where I worked for the Atrius Building Commission to negotiate some contracts,\"" Scotti took another bite of the dried sausages they were sharing for dinner. \""We're going to try to repair and refurbish whatever bridges, roads, and other structures that got damaged in the recent war with the Khajiiti.\""""},{""text1"":""\""It's been a hard two years,\"" the captain nodded his head. \""Though I suppose good for me and the likes of you and your friend.

The first casualties of war is always the corrupted.\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti said he was sorry to hear that, and they lapsed into silence, watching the stars and moons' reflection on the still water.   The next day, Scotti awoke to find the captain wrapped up in his sail, torpid from alcohol, singing in a low, slurred voice.  When he saw Scotti rise, he offered his flagon of jagga.""},{""text1"":""\""I learned my lesson during revelry at western cross.\""""},{""text1"":""The captain laughed, and then burst into tears, \""I don't want to be legitimate.  Other pirates I used to know are still raping and stealing and smuggling and selling nice folk like you into slavery.  I swear to you, I never thought the first time that I ran a real shipment of legal goods that my life would turn out like this.  Oh, I know, I could go back to it, but Baan Dar knows not after all I've seen.  I'm a ruined man.\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti helped the weeping mer out of the sail, murmuring words of reassurance.  Then he added, \""Forgive me for changing the subject, but where are we?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Oh,\"" moaned Captain Balfix miserably. \""We made good time.  Athay's right around the bend in the river.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Then it looks like Athay's on fire,\"" said Scotti, pointing.""},{""text1"":""A great plume of smoke black as pitch was rising above the trees.  As they drifted around the bend, they next saw the flames, and then the blackened skeletal remains of the village.  Dying, blazing villagers leapt from rocks into the river.  A cacophony of wailing met their ears, and they could see, roaming along the edges of the town, the figures of Khajiiti soldiers bearing torches.""},{""text1"":""\""Baan Dar bless me!\"" slurred the captain. \""The war's back on!\""""},{""text1"":""\""Oh, no,\"" whimpered Scotti.""},{""text1"":""The sloop drifted with the current toward the opposite shore away from the fiery town.  Scotti turned his attention there, and the sanctuary it offered.  Just a peaceful arbor, away from the horror.  There was a shudder of leaves in two of the trees and a dozen lithe Khajiit dropped to the ground, armed with bows.""},{""text1"":""\""They see us,\"" hissed Scotti. \""And they've got bows!\""""},{""text1"":""\""Well, of course they have bows,\"" snarled Captain Balfix. \""We Bosmer may have invented the bloody things, but we didn't think to keep them secret, you bloody bureaucrat.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Now, they're setting their arrows on fire!\""""},{""text1"":""\""Yes, they do that sometimes.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Captain, they're shooting at us!  They're shooting at us with flaming arrows!\""""},{""text1"":""\""Ah, so they are,\"" the captain agreed. \""The aim here is to avoid being hit.\""""},{""text1"":""But hit they were, and very shortly thereafter.  Even worse, the second volley of arrows hit the supply of pitch, which ignited in a tremendous blue blaze.  Scotti grabbed Captain Balfix and they leapt overboard just before the ship and all its cargo disintegrated.  The shock of the cold water brought the Bosmer into temporary sobriety.  He called to Scotti, who was already swimming as fast as he could toward the bend.""},{""text1"":""\""Master Decumus, where do you think you're swimming to?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Back to Falinesti!\"" cried Scotti.""},{""text1"":""\""It will take you days, and by the time you get there, everyone will know about the attack on Athay!  They'll never let anyone they don't know in!  The closest village downriver is Grenos, maybe they'll give us shelter!\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti swam back to the captain and side-by-side they began paddling in the middle of the river, past the burning residuum of the village.  He thanked Mara that he had learned to swim.  Many a Cyrodiil did not, as largely land-locked as the Imperial Province was.  Had he been raised in Mir Corrup or Artemon, he might have been doomed, but the Imperial City itself was encircled by water, and every lad and lass there knew how to cross without a boat.  Even those who grew up to be clerks and not adventurers.""},{""text1"":""Captain Balfix's sobriety faded as he grew used to the water's temperature.  Even in wintertide, the Xylo River was fairly temperate and after a fashion, even comfortable.  The Bosmer's strokes were uneven, and he'd stray closer to Scotti and then further away, pushing ahead and then falling behind.""},{""text1"":""Scotti looked to the shore to his right: the flames had caught the trees like tinder.  Behind them was an inferno, with which they were barely keeping pace.  To the shore on their left, all looked fair, until he saw a tremble in the river-reeds, and then what caused it.  A pride of the largest cats he had ever seen.  They were auburn-haired, green-eyed beasts with jaws and teeth to match his wildest nightmares.  And they were watching the two swimmers, and keeping pace.""},{""text1"":""\""Captain Balfix, we can't go to either that shore or the other one, or we'll be parboiled or eaten,\"" Scotti whispered. \""Try to even your kicking and your strokes.  Breath like you would normally.  If you're feeling tired, tell me, and we'll float on our backs for a while.\""""},{""text1"":""Anyone who has had the experience of giving rational advice to a drunkard would understand the hopelessness.  Scotti kept pace with the captain, slowing himself, quickening, drifting left and right, while the Bosmer moaned old ditties from his pirate days.  When he wasn't watching his companion, he watched the cats on the shore.  After a stretch, he turned to his right.  Another village had caught fire.  Undoubtedly, it was Grenos.  Scotti stared at the blazing fury, awed by the sight of the destruction, and did not hear that the captain had ceased to sing.""},{""text1"":""When he turned back, Captain Balfix was gone.""},{""text1"":""Scotti dove into the murky depths of the river over and over again.  There was nothing to be done.  When he surfaced after his final search, he saw that the giant cats had moved on, perhaps assuming that he too had drowned.  He continued his lonely swim downriver.  A tributary, he noted, had formed a final barrier, keeping the flames from spreading further.  But there were no more towns.  After several hours, he began to ponder the wisdom of going ashore.  Which shore was the question.""},{""text1"":""He was spared the decision.  Ahead of him was a rocky island with a bonfire.  He did not know if he were intruding on a party of Bosmeri or Khajiiti, only that he could swim no more.

They were the survivors of both the villages of Grenos and Athay, and war was on every person's lips.  Why had the Khajiiti attacked again?

When he turned to face them, the lithe forms vanished into the gloom as if they had never been there. But he knew he had seen them. And the Bosmeri saw them too, and quickened their pace.""},{""text1"":""After eighteen hours, bitten raw by insects, scratched by a thousand thorns, they emerged into a valley clearing. It was night, but a row of blazing torches greeted them, illuminating the leather-wrought tents and jumbled stones of the hamlet of Vindisi. At the end of the valley, the torches marked a sacred site, a gnarled bower of trees pressed closed together to form a temple. Wordlessly, the Bosmeri walked the torch arcade toward the trees. Scotti followed them. When they reached the solid mass of living wood with only one gaping portal, Scotti could see a dim blue light glowing within. A low sonorous moan from a hundred voices echoed within. The Bosmeri maiden he had been following held out her hand, stopping him.""},{""text1"":""\""You do not understand, but no outsider, not even a friend may enter,\"" she said. \""This is a holy place.\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti nodded, and watched the refugees march into the temple, heads bowed. Their voices joined with the ones within. When the last wood elf had gone inside, Scotti turned his attention back to the village. There must be food to be had somewhere. A tendril of smoke and a faint whiff of roasting venison beyond the torchlight led him.""},{""text1"":""They were five Cyrodiils, two Bretons, and a Nord, the group gathered around a campfire of glowing white stones, pulling steaming strips of meat from the cadaver of a great stag. At Scotti's approach, they rose up, all but the Nord who was distracted by his hunk of animal flesh.""},{""text1"":""\""Good evening, sorry to interrupt, but I was wondering if I might have a little something to eat.

They're all villains of the worst order.\""""},{""text1"":""\""What are you doing here?\"" asked Scotti.""},{""text1"":""\""I'm a diplomat from the court of Jehenna,\"" muttered the Nord, returning to his food.""},{""text1"":""\""What about you, what are you doing here?\"" asked one of the Cyrodiils.""},{""text1"":""\""I work for Lord Atrius's building commission in the Imperial City,\"" said Scotti. \""One of my former colleagues suggested that I come down to Valenwood. He said the war was over, and I could contract a great deal of business for my firm rebuilding what was lost. One disaster after another, and I've lost all my money, I'm in the middle of a rekindling of war, and I cannot find my former colleague.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Your former colleague,\"" murmured another of the Cyrodiils, who had introduced himself as Reglius. \""He wasn't by any chance named Liodes Jurus, was he?\""""},{""text1"":""\""You know him?\""""},{""text1"":""\""He lured me down to Valenwood in nearly the exact same circumstances,\"" smiled Reglius, grimly. \""I worked for your employer's competitor, Lord Vanech's men, where Liodes Jurus also formerly worked. He wrote to me, asking that I represent an Imperial building commission and contract some post-war construction.  I had just been released from my employment, and I thought that if I brought some new business, I could have my job back. Jurus and I met in Athay, and he said he was going to arrange a very lucrative meeting with the Silvenar.\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti was stunned: \""Where is he now?\""""},{""text1"":""\""I'm no theologian, so I couldn't say,\"" Reglius shrugged. \""He's dead. When the Khajiiti attacked Athay, they began by torching the harbor where Jurus was readying his boat. Or, I should say, my boat since it was purchased with the gold I brought. By the time we were even aware of what was happening enough to flee, everything by the water was ash. The Khajiiti may be animals, but they know how to arrange an attack.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I think they followed us through the jungle to Vindisi,\"" said Scotti nervously. \""There was definitely a group of something jumping along the treetops.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Probably one of the monkey folk,\"" snorted the Nord. \""Nothing to be concerned about.\""""},{""text1"":""\""When we first came to Vindisi and the Bosmeri all entered that tree, they were furious, whispering something about unleashing an ancient terror on their enemies,\"" the Breton shivered, remembering. \""They've been there ever since, for over a day and a half now. If you want something to be afraid of, that's the direction to look.\""""},{""text1"":""The other Breton, who was a representative of the Daggerfall Mages Guild, was staring off into the darkness while his fellow provincial spoke. \""Maybe.

The Nord and one of the Cyrodiils grabbed a long tarp of wet leather and pulled it across the fire, instantly extinguishing it without so much as a sizzle. Now Scotti could see the intruders, their elliptical yellow eyes and long cruel blades catching the torchlight. He froze with fear, praying that he too was not so visible to them.""},{""text1"":""He felt something bump against his back, and gasped.""},{""text1"":""Reglius's voice hissed from up above: \""Be quiet for Mara's sake and climb up here.\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti grabbed hold of the knotted double-vine that hung down from a tall tree at the edge of the dead campfire. He scrambled up it as quickly as he could, holding his breath lest any grunt of exertion escape him. At the top of the vine, high above the village, was an abandoned nest from some great bird in a trident-shaped branch. As soon as Scotti had pulled himself into the soft, fragrant straw, Reglius pulled up the vine. No one else was there, and when Scotti looked down, he could see no one below. No one, that is except the Khajiiti, slowly moving toward the glow of the temple tree.""},{""text1"":""\""Thank you,\"" whispered Scotti, deeply touched that a competitor had helped him. He turned away from the village, and saw that the tree's upper branches brushed against the mossy rock walls that surrounded the valley below. \""How are you at climbing?\""""},{""text1"":""\""You're mad,\"" said Reglius under his breath. \""We should stay here until they leave.\""""},{""text1"":""\""If they burn Vindisi like they did Athay and Grenos, we'll be dead sure as if we were on the ground,\"" Scotti began the slow careful climb up the tree, testing each branch. \""Can you see what they're doing?\""""},{""text1"":""\""I can't really tell,\"" Reglius stared down into the gloom. \""They're at the front of the temple. I think they also have ... it looks like long ropes, trailing off behind them, off into the pass.\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti crawled onto the strongest branch that pointed toward the wet, rocky face of the cliff. It was not a far jump at all. So close, in fact, that he could smell the moisture and feel the coolness of the stone. But it was a jump nevertheless, and in his history as a clerk, he had never before leapt from a tree a hundred feet off the ground to a sheer rock. He pictured in his mind's eye the shadows that had pursued him through the jungle from the heights above. How their legs coiled to spring, how their arms snapped forward in an elegant fluid motion to grasp. He leapt.""},{""text1"":""His hands grappled for rock, but long thick cords of moss were more accessible. He held hard, but when he tried to plant his feet forward, they slipped up skyward. For a few seconds, he found himself upside down before he managed to pull himself into a more conventional position. There was a narrow outcropping jutting out of the cliff where he could stand and finally exhale.""},{""text1"":""\""Reglius. Reglius. Reglius,\"" Scotti did not dare to call out. In a minute, there was a shaking of branches, and Lord Vanech's man emerged. First his satchel, then his head, then the rest of him. Scotti started to whisper something, but Reglius shook his head violently and pointed downward. One of the Khajiiti was at the base of the tree, peering at the remains of the campfire.""},{""text1"":""Reglius awkwardly tried to balance himself on the branch, but as strong as it was it was exceedingly difficult with only one free hand. Scotti cupped his palms and then pointed at the satchel. It seemed to pain Reglius to let it out of his grasp, but he relented and tossed it to Scotti.""},{""text1"":""There was a small, almost invisible hole in the bag, and when Scotti caught it, a single gold coin dropped out. It rang as it bounced against the rock wall on the descent, a high soft sound that seemed like the loudest alarm Scotti had ever heard.""},{""text1"":""Then many things happened very quickly.""},{""text1"":""The Cathay-Raht at the base of the tree looked up and gave a loud wail. The other Khajiiti followed in chorus, as the cat below crouched down and then sprung up into the lower branches. Reglius saw it below him, climbing up with impossible dexterity, and panicked. Even before he jumped, Scotti could tell that he was going to fall. With a cry, Reglius the Clerk plunged to the ground, breaking his neck on impact.""},{""text1"":""A flash of white fire erupted from every crevice of the temple, and the moan of the Bosmeri prayer changed into something terrible and otherworldly. The climbing Cathay-Raht stopped and stared.""},{""text1"":""\""Keirgo,\"" it gasped. \""The Wild Hunt.\""""},{""text1"":""It was as if a crack in reality had opened wide. A flood of horrific beasts, tentacled toads, insects of armor and spine, gelatinous serpents, vaporous beings with the face of gods, all poured forth from the great hollow tree, blind with fury. They tore the Khajiiti in front of the temple to pieces. All the other cats fled for the jungle, but as they did so, they began pulling on the ropes they carried. In a few seconds time, the entire village of Vindisi was boiling with the lunatic apparitions of the Wild Hunt.""},{""text1"":""Over the babbling, barking, howling horde, Scotti heard the Cyrodiils in hiding cry out as they were devoured. The Nord too was found and eaten, and both Bretons. The wizard had turned himself invisible, but the swarm did not rely on their sight. The tree the Cathay-Raht was in began to sway and rock from the impossible violence beneath it. Scotti looked at the Khajiiti's fear-struck eyes, and held out one of the cords of moss.""},{""text1"":""The cat's face showed its pitiful gratitude as it leapt for the vine. It didn't have time to entirely replace that expression when Scotti pulled back the cord, and watched it fall. The Hunt consumed it to the bone before it struck the ground.""},{""text1"":""Scotti's own jump up to the next outcropping of rock was immeasurably more successful. From there, he pulled himself to the top of the cliff and was able to look down into the chaos that had been the village of Vindisi. The Hunt's mass had grown and began to spill out through the pass out of the valley, pursuing the fleeing Khajiiti. It was then that the madness truly began.""},{""text1"":""In the moons' light, from Scotti's vantage, he could see where the Khajiiti had attached their ropes. With a thunderous boom, an avalanche of boulders poured over the pass. When the dust cleared, he saw that the valley had been sealed. The Wild Hunt had nowhere to turn but on itself.""},{""text1"":""Scotti turned his head, unable to bear to look at the cannibalistic orgy. The night jungle stood before him, a web of wood. He slung Reglius's satchel over his shoulder, and entered.""},{""text1"":""A Dance in Fire""},{""text1"":""Chapter 5""},{""text1"":""\nby\nWaughin Jarth""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""\n\""Soap! The forest will eat love!  Straight ahead!  Stupid and a stupid cow!\""""},{""text1"":""The voice boomed out so suddenly that Decumus Scotti jumped.  He stared off into the dim jungle glade from which he only heard animal and insect calls, and the low whistling of wind moments before.  It was a queer, oddly accented voice of indiscriminate gender, tremulous in its modulations, but unmistakably human.  Or, at very least, elven.  An isolated Bosmer perhaps with a poor grasp of the Cyrodilic language.  After countless hours of plodding through the dense knot of Valenwood jungle, any voice of slight familiarity sounded wondrous.""},{""text1"":""\""Hello?\"" he cried.""},{""text1"":""\""Beetles on any names?  Certainly yesterday yes!\"" the voice called back. \""Who, what, and when, and mice!\""""},{""text1"":""\""I'm afraid I don't understand,\"" replied Scotti, turning toward the brambled tree, thick as a wagon, where the voice had issued. \""But you needn't be afraid of me.  My name is Decumus Scotti.  I'm a Cyrodiil from the Imperial City.  I came here to help rebuild Valenwood after the war, you see, and now I'm rather lost.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Gemstones and grilled slaves ... The war,\"" moaned the voice and broke down into sobs.""},{""text1"":""\""You know about the war?  I wasn't sure, I wasn't even sure how far away from the border I am now,\"" Scotti began slowly walking toward the tree.  He dropped Reglius's satchel to the ground, and held out his empty hands. \""I'm unarmed.  I only want to know the way to the closest town.  I'm trying to meet my friend, Liodes Jurus, in Silvenar.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Silvenar!\"" the voice laughed.  It laughed even louder as Scotti circled the tree. \""Worms and wine!  Worms and wine!  Silvenar sings for worms and wine!\""""},{""text1"":""There was nothing to be found anywhere around the tree. \""I don't see you.  Why are you hiding?\""""},{""text1"":""In frustration born of hunger and exhaustion, he struck the tree trunk.  A sudden shiver of gold and red erupted from a hollow nook above, and Scotti was surrounded by six winged creatures scarcely more than a few inches long.  Bright crimson eyes were set on either side of tunnel-like protuberances, the animals' always open mouths.  They were legless, and their thin, rapidly beating, aureate wings seemed poorly constructed to transport their fat, swollen bellies.  And yet, they darted through the air like sparks from a fire.  Whirling about the poor clerk, they began chattering what he now understood to be perfect nonsense.""},{""text1"":""\""Wines and worms, how far from the border am I!  Academic garnishments, and alas, Liodes Jurus!\""""},{""text1"":""\""Hello, I'm afraid I'm unarmed?  Smoken flames and the closest town is dear Oblivion.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Swollen on bad meat, an indigo nimbus, but you needn't be afraid of me!\""""},{""text1"":""\""Why are you hiding?  Why are you hiding?  Before I begin to friend, love me, Lady Zuleika!\""""},{""text1"":""Furious with the mimics, Scotti swung his arms, driving them up into the treetops.  He stomped back to the clearing and opened up the satchel again, as he had done some hours before.  There was still, unsurprisingly, nothing useful in the bag, and nothing to eat in any corner or pocket.  A goodly amount of gold (he smiled grimly, as he had done before, at the irony of being financially solvent in the jungle), a stack of neat blank contracts from Lord Vanech's building commission, some thin cord, and an oiled leather cloak for bad weather.  At least, Scotti considered, he had not suffered rain.""},{""text1"":""A rolling moan of thunder reminded Scotti of what he had suspected for some weeks now.  He was cursed.""},{""text1"":""Within an hour's time, he was wearing the cloak and clawing his way through mud.  The trees, which had earlier allowed no sunlight in, provided no shelter against the pounding storm and wind.  The only sounds that pierced the pelting of the rain were the mocking calls of the flying creatures, flitting just above, babbling their nonsense.  Scotti bellowed at them, threw rocks, but they seemed enamored of his company.""},{""text1"":""While he was reaching to grab a promising looking stone to hurl at his tormentors, Scotti felt something shift beneath his feet.  Wet but solid ground suddenly liquefied and became a rolling tide, rushing him forward.  Light as a leaf, he flew head over feet over head, until the mudflow dropped and he continued forward, plunging down into a river twenty-five feet below.""},{""text1"":""The storm passed quite as instantly as it had arrived.  The sun melted the dark clouds and warmed Scotti as he swam for the shore.  There, another sign of the Khajiiti incursion into Valenwood greeted him.  A small fishing village had stood there once, so recently extinct that it smoldered like a still-warm corpse.  Dirt cairns that had once housed fish by the smell of them had been ravaged, their bounty turned to ash.  Rafts and skiffs lay broken, scuttled, half-submerged.  All the villagers were no more, either dead or refugees far away.  Or so he presumed.  Something banged against the wall of one of the ruins.  Scotti ran to investigate.""},{""text1"":""\""My name is Decumus Scotti?\"" sang the first winged beast. \""I'm a Cyrodiil from?  The Imperial City?  I came here to help rebuild Valenwood after the war, you see, and now I'm rather lost?\""""},{""text1"":""\""I swell to maculate, apeneck!\"" agreed one of its companions. \""I don't see you.  Why are you hiding?\""""},{""text1"":""As they fell into chattering, Scotti began to search the rest of the village.  Surely the cats had left something behind, a scrap of dried meat, a morsel of fish sausage, anything.  But they had been immaculate in their complete annihilation.  There was nothing to eat anywhere.  Scotti did find one item of possible use under the tumbled remains of a stone hut.  A bow and two arrows made of bone.  The string had been lost, likely burned away in the heat of the fire, but he pulled the cord from Reglius's satchel and restrung it.""},{""text1"":""The creatures flew over and hovered nearby as he worked: \""The convent of the sacred Liodes Jurus?\""""},{""text1"":""\""You know about the war!  Worms and wine, circumscribe a golden host, apeneck!\""""},{""text1"":""The moment the cord was taut, Scotti nocked an arrow and swung around, pulling the string tight against his chest.  The winged beasts, having had experience with archers before, shot off in all directions in a blur.  They needn't have bothered.  Scotti's first arrow dove into the ground three feet in front of him.  He swore and retrieved it.  The mimics, having likewise had experience with poor archers before, returned at once to hovering nearby and mocking Scotti.""},{""text1"":""On his second shot, Scotti did much better, in purely technical terms.  He remembered how the archers in Falinesti looked when he pulled himself out from under the hoarvor tick, and they were all taking aim at him.  He extended his left hand, right hand, and right elbow in a symmetrical line, drawing the bow so his hand touched his jawline, and he could see the creature in his sight like the arrow was a finger he was pointing with.  The bolt missed the target by only two feet, but it continued on its trajectory, snapping when it struck a rock wall.""},{""text1"":""Scotti walked to the river's edge.  He had only one arrow left, and perhaps, he considered, it would be most practical to find a slow-moving fish and fire it on that.  If he missed, at least there was less of a chance of breaking the shaft, and he could always retrieve it from the water.  A rather torpid, whiskered fish rolled by, and he took aim at it.""},{""text1"":""\""My name is Decumus Scotti!\"" one of the creatures howled, frightening the fish away. \""Stupid and a stupid cow!  Will you dance a dance in fire!\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti turned and aimed the arrow as he had done before.  This time, however, he remembered to plant his feet as the archers had done, seven inches apart, knees straight, left leg slightly forward to meet the angle of his right shoulder.  He released the last arrow.""},{""text1"":""The arrow also proved a serviceable prong for roasting the creature against the smoking hot stones of one of the ruins.  Its other companions had disappeared instantly after the beast was slain, and Scotti was able to dine in peace.  The meat proved to be delicious, if scarcely more than a first course.  He was picking the last of it from the bones, when a boat sailed into view from around the bend of the river.  At the helm were Bosmer sailors.  Scotti ran to the bank and waved his arms.  They averted their eyes and continued past.""},{""text1"":""\""You bloody, callous bastards!\"" Scotti howled. \""Knaves!  Hooligans! Apenecks!  Scoundrels!\""""},{""text1"":""A gray-whiskered form came out from a hatch, and Scotti immediately recognized him as Gryf Mallon, the poet translator he had met in the caravan from Cyrodiil.""},{""text1"":""He peered Scotti's direction, and his eyes lit up with delight, \""Decumus Scotti!  Precisely the man I hoped to see!  I want to get your thoughts on a rather puzzling passage in the Mnoriad Pley Bar!  It begins 'I went weeping into the world, searching for wonders,' perhaps you're familiar with it?\""""},{""text1"":""\""I'd like nothing better than to discuss the Mnoriad Pley Bar with you, Gryf!\"" Scotti called back. \""Would you let me come aboard though first?\""""},{""text1"":""Overjoyed at being on a ship bound for any port at all, Scotti was true to his word.  For over an hour as the boat rolled down the river past the blackened remnants of Bosmeri villages, he asked no questions and spoke nothing of his life over the past weeks: he merely listened to Mallon's theories of merethic Aldmeri esoterica.  The translator was undemanding of his guest's scholarship, accepting nods and shrugs as civilized conversation.  He even produced some wine and fish jelly, which he shared with Scotti absent-mindedly, as he expounded on his various theses.""},{""text1"":""Finally, while Mallon was searching for a reference to some minor point in his notes, Scotti asked, \""Rather off subject, but I was wondering where we're bound.\""""},{""text1"":""\""The very heart of the province, Silvenar,\"" Mallon said, not looking up from the passage he was reading. \""It's somewhat bothersome, actually, as I wanted to go to Woodhearth first to talk to a Bosmer there who claims to have an original copy of Dirith Yalmillhiad, if you can believe it.  But for the time being, that has to wait.  Summurset Isle has surrounded the city, and is in the process of starving the citizenry until they surrender.  It's a tiresome prospect, since the Bosmeri are happy to eat one another, so there's a risk that at the end, only one fat wood elf will remain to wave the flag.\""""},{""text1"":""\""That is vexing,\"" agreed Scotti, sympathetically. \""To the east, the Khajiiti are burning everything, and to the west, the High Elves are waging war.  I don't suppose the borders to the north are clear?\""""},{""text1"":""\""They're even worse,\"" replied Mallon, finger on the page, still distracted. \""The Cyrodiils and Redguards don't want Bosmer refugees streaming into their provinces.  It only stands to reason.  Imagine how much more criminally inclined they'd be now that they're homeless and hungry.\""""},{""text1"":""\""So,\"" murmured Scotti, feeling a shiver. \""We're trapped in Valenwood.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Not at all.  I need to leave fairly shortly myself, as my publisher has set a very definite deadline for my new book of translations.  From what I understand, one merely petitions to the Silvenar for special border protection and one can cross into Cyrodiil with impunity.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Petition the Silvenar, or petition at Silvenar?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Petition the Silvenar at Silvenar.  It's an odd nomenclature that is typical of this place, the sort of thing that makes my job as a translator that much more challenging.  The Silvenar, he, or rather they are the closest the Bosmeri have to a great leader.  The essential thing to remember about the Silvenar --\"" Mallon smiled, finding the passage he was looking for, \""Here! 'A fortnight, inexplicable, the world burns into a dance.' There's that metaphor again.\""""},{""text1"":""\""What were you saying about the Silvenar?\"" asked Scotti. \""The essential thing to remember?\""""},{""text1"":""\""I don't remember what I was saying,\"" replied Mallon, turning back to his oration.""},{""text1"":""In a week's time, the little boat bumped along the shallow, calmer waters of the foaming current the Xylo had become, and Decumus Scotti first saw the city of Silvenar.  If Falinesti was a tree, then Silvenar was a flower.  A magnificent pile of faded shades of green, red, blue, and white, shining with crystalline residue.  Mallon had mentioned off-hand, when not otherwise explaining Aldmeri prosody, that Silvenar had once been a blossoming glade in the forest, but owing to some spell or natural cause, the trees' sap began flowing with translucent liqueur.  The process of the sap flowing and hardening over the colorful trees had formed the web of the city.  Mallon's description was intriguing, but it hardly prepared him for the city's beauty.""},{""text1"":""\""What is the finest, most luxurious tavern here?\"" Scotti asked one of the Bosmer boatmen.""},{""text1"":""\""Prithala Hall,\"" Mallon answered. \""But why don't you stay with me?

And then, after a day or two, I'll petition the Silvenar for safe passage to Cyrodiil.\""""},{""text1"":""The men bade each other goodbye.  Gryf Mallon gave him the address of his publisher in the Imperial City, which Scotti accepted and quickly forgot.  The clerk wandered the streets of Silvenar, crossing bridges of amber, admiring the petrified forest architecture.  In front of a particularly estimable palace of silvery reflective crystal, he found Prithala Hall.""},{""text1"":""He took the finest room, and ordered a gluttonous meal of the finest quality.  At a nearby table, he saw two very fat fellows, a man and a Bosmer, remarking how much finer the food was there than at the Silvenar's palace.

The man noticed Scotti looking at them, and his eyes flashed recognition.""},{""text1"":""\""Scotti, is that you?  Kynareth, where have you been?

All the other sounds and textures of Prithala Hall vanished all around him, as if nothing else existed but the vast form of Jurus. Scotti did not consider himself an emotional man, but he felt a tide flow over him at the sight and sound of the man whose badly written letters had been the guideposts that carried him from the Imperial City back in early Frost Fall.""},{""text1"":""\""Where have you been?\"" Jurus demanded again. \""I told you to meet me in Falinesti weeks ago.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I was there weeks ago,\"" Scotti stammered, too surprised to be indignant. \""I got your note to meet you in Athay, and so I went there, but the Khajiiti had burned it to the ground.

The thought of doing business with Jurus after all, of profiting from Valenwood war with Elsweyr, and now the second one with the Summurset Isle, seemed like something happening to another person.""},{""text1"":""\""Your colleague and I were talking about the Silvenar,\"" said Basth, putting down the leg of mutton he had been gnawing on. \""I don't suppose you've heard about his nature?\""""},{""text1"":""\""A little, but nothing very specific.

When they're mostly female, so is he.  When they cry for food or trade or an absence of foreign interference, he feels it too, and makes laws accordingly.  In a way, he's a despot, but he's the people's despot.\""""},{""text1"":""\""That sounds,\"" said Scotti, searching for the appropriate word. \""Like ... bunk.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Perhaps it is,\"" shrugged Basth. \""But he has many rights as the Voice of the People, including the granting of foreign building and trade contracts.  It's not important whether you believe us.  Just think of the Silvenar as being like one of your mad Emperors, like Pelagius.  The problem facing us now is that since Valenwood is being attacked on all sides, the Silvenar's aspect is now one of distrust and fear of foreigners.  The one hope of his people, and thus of the Silvenar himself, is that the Emperor will intervene and stop the war.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Will he?\"" asked Scotti.""},{""text1"":""\""You know as well as we do that the Emperor has not been himself lately,\"" Jurus helped himself to Reglius's satchel and pulled out the blank contracts. \""Who knows what he'll choose to do or not do?  That reality is not our concern, but these blessings from the late good sir Reglius make our job much simpler.\""""},{""text1"":""They discussed how they would represent themselves to the Silvenar into the evening.  Scotti ate continuously, but not nearly so much as Jurus and Basth.  When the sun had begun to rise in the hills, its light reddening through the crystal walls of the tavern, Jurus and Basth left to their rooms at the palace, granted to them diplomatically in lieu of an actual immediate audience with the Silvenar.  Scotti went to his room.  He thought about staying up a little longer to ruminate over Jurus's plans and see what might be the flaw in them, but upon touching the cool, soft bed, he immediately fell asleep.""},{""text1"":""The next afternoon, Scotti awoke, feeling himself again.  In other words, timid.  For several weeks now, he had been a creature bent on mere survival.  He had been driven to exhaustion, attacked by several jungle beasts, starved, nearly drowned, and forced into discussions of ancient Aldmeri poetical works.  The discussion he had with Jurus and Basth about how to dupe the Silvenar into signing their contracts seemed perfectly reasonable then.  Scotti dressed himself in his old battered clothes and went downstairs in search of food and a peaceful place to think.""},{""text1"":""\""You're up,\"" cried Basth upon seeing him. \""We should go to the palace now.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Now?\"" whined Scotti. \""Look at me.  I need new clothes.  This isn't the way one should dress to pay a call on a prostitute, let alone the Voice of the People of Valenwood.  I haven't even bathed.\""""},{""text1"":""\""You must cease from this moment forward being a clerk, and become a student of mercantile trade,\"" said Liodes Jurus grandly, taking Scotti by the arm and leading him into the sunlit boulevard outside. \""The first rule is to recognize what you represent to the prospective client, and what angle best suits you.  You cannot dazzle him with opulent fashion and professional bearing, my dear boy, and it would be fatal if you attempted to.   Trust me on this.  Several others besides Basth and I are guests at the palace, and they have made the error of appearing too eager, too formal, too ready for business.  They will never be granted audience with the Silvenar, but we have remained aloof ever since the initial rejection.  I've dallied about the court, spread my knowledge of life in the Imperial City, had my ears pierced, attended promenades, eaten and drunk of all that was given to me.  I dare say I've put on a pound or two.  The message we've sent is clear: it is in his, not our, best interest to meet.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Our plan worked,\"" added Basth. \""When I told his minister that our Imperial representative had arrived, and that we were at last willing to meet with the Silvenar this morning, we were told to bring you there straightaway.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Aren't we late then?\"" asked Scotti.""},{""text1"":""\""Very,\"" laughed Jurus. \""But that's again part of the angle we're representing.  Benevolent disinterest.  Remember not to confuse the Silvenar with conventional nobility.  His is the mind of the common people.  When you grasp that, you'll understand how to manipulate him.\""""},{""text1"":""Jurus spent the last several minutes of the walk through the city expounding on his theories about what Valenwood needed, how much, and at what price.  They were staggering figures, far more construction and far higher costs than anything Scotti had been used to dealing with.  He listened carefully.  All around them, the city of Silvenar revealed itself, glass and flower, roaring winds and beautiful inertia.  When they reached the palace of the Silvenar, Decumus Scotti stopped, stunned.  Jurus looked at him for a moment and then laughed.""},{""text1"":""\""It's quite bizarre, isn't it?\""""},{""text1"":""That it was.  A frozen scarlet burst of twisted, uneven spires as if a rival sun rising.  A blossom the size of a village, where courtiers and servants resembled nothing so much as insects walked about it sucking its ichor.  Entering over a bent petal-like bridge, the three walked through the palace of unbalanced walls.  Where the partitions bent close together and touched, there was a shaded hall or a small chamber.  Where they warped away from one another, there was a courtyard.  There were no doors anywhere, no any way to get to the Silvenar but by crossing through the entire spiral of the palace, through meetings and bedrooms and dining halls, past dignitaries, consorts, musicians, and many guards.""},{""text1"":""\""It's an interesting place,\"" said Basth. \""But not very much privacy.  Of course, that suits the Silvenar well.\""""},{""text1"":""When they reached the inner corridors, two hours after they first entered the palace, guards, brandishing blades and bows, stopped them.""},{""text1"":""\""We have an audience with the Silvenar,\"" said Jurus, patiently. \""This is Lord Decumus Scotti, the Imperial representative.\""""},{""text1"":""One of the guards disappeared down the winding corridor, and returned moments later with a tall, proud Bosmer clad in a loose robe of patchwork leather.  He was the Minister of Trade: \""The Silvenar wishes to speak with Lord Decumus Scotti alone.\""""},{""text1"":""It was not the place to argue or show fear, so Scotti stepped forward, not even looking toward Jurus and Basth.  He was certain they were showing their masks of benevolent indifference.  Following the Minister into the audience chamber, Scotti recited to himself all the facts and figures Jurus had presented to him.  He willed himself to remember the Angle and the Image he must project.""},{""text1"":""The audience chamber of the Silvenar was an enormous dome where the walls bent from bowl-shaped at the base inward to almost meet at the top.  A thin ray of sunlight streamed through the fissure hundreds of feet above, and directly upon the Silvenar, who stood upon a puff of shimmering gray powder.  For all the wonder of the city and the palace, the Silvenar himself looked perfectly ordinary.  An average, blandly handsome, slightly tired-looking, extra-ordinary Wood Elf of the type one might see in any capitol in the Empire.  It was only when he stepped from the dais that Scotti noticed an eccentricity in his appearance.  He was very short.""},{""text1"":""\""I had to speak with you alone,\"" said the Silvenar in a voice common and unrefined. \""May I see your papers?\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti handed him the blank contracts from Lord Vanech's Building Commission.  The Silvenar studied them, running his finger over the embossed seal of the Emperor, before handing them back.  He suddenly seemed shy, looking to the floor.  \""There are many charlatans at my court who wish to benefit from the wars.  I thought you and your colleagues were among them, but those contracts are genuine.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Yes, they are,\"" said Scotti calmly.  The Silvenar's conventional aspect made it easy for Scotti to speak, with no formal greetings, no deference, exactly as Jurus had instructed: \""It seems most sensible to begin straightaway talking about the roads which need to be rebuilt, and then the harbors that the Altmeri have destroyed, and then I can give you my estimates on the cost of resupplying and renovating the trade routes.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Why hasn't the Emperor seen fit to send a representative when the war with Elsweyr began, two years ago?\"" asked the Silvenar glumly.""},{""text1"":""Scotti thought a moment before replying of all the common Bosmeri he had met in Valenwood.  The greedy, frightened mercenaries who had escorted him from the border.  The hard-drinking revelers and expert pest exterminating archers in the Western Cross of Falinesti.  Nosy old Mother Pascost in Havel Slump.  Captain Balfix, the poor sadly reformed pirate.  The terrified but hopeful refugees of Athay and Grenos.  The mad, murderous, self-devouring Wild Hunt of Vindisi.  The silent, dour boatmen hired by Gryf Mallon.  The degenerate, grasping Basth.  If one creature represented their total disposition, and that of many more throughout the province,  what would be his personality?  Scotti was a clerk by occupation and nature, instinctively comfortable cataloging and filing, making things fit in a system.  If the soul of Valenwood were to be filed, where would it be put?""},{""text1"":""The answer came upon him almost before he posed himself the question.  Denial.""},{""text1"":""\""I'm afraid that question doesn't interest me,\"" said Scotti. \""Now, can we get back to the business at hand?\""""},{""text1"":""All afternoon, Scotti and the Silvenar discussed the pressing needs of Valenwood.  Every contract was filled and signed.  So much was required and there were so many costs associated that addendums and codicils had to be scribbled into the margins of the papers, and those had to be resigned.  Scotti maintained his benevolent indifference, but he found that dealing with the Silvenar was not quite the same as dealing with a simple, sullen child.  The Voice of the People knew certain practical, everyday things very well: the yields of fish, the benefits of trade, the condition of every township and forest in his province.""},{""text1"":""\""We will have a banquet tomorrow night to celebrate this commission,\"" said the Silvenar at last.""},{""text1"":""\""Best make it tonight,\"" replied Scotti. \""We should leave for Cyrodiil with the contracts tomorrow, so I'll need a safe passage to the border.  We best not waste any more time.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Agreed,\"" said the Silvenar, and called for his Minister of Trade to put his seal on the contracts and arrange for the feast.""},{""text1"":""Scotti left the chamber, and was greeted by Basth and Jurus.  Their faces showed the strain of maintaining the illusion of unconcern for too many hours.  As soon as they were out of sight of the guards, they begged Scotti to tell them all.  When he showed them the contract, Basth began weeping with delight.""},{""text1"":""\""Anything about the Silvenar that surprised you?\"" asked Jurus.""},{""text1"":""\""I hadn't expected him to be half my height.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Was he?\"" Jurus looked mildly surprised. \""He must have shrunk since I tried to have an audience with him earlier.  Maybe there is something to all that nonsense about him being affected by the plight of his people.\""\n ""},{""text1"":""A Dance in Fire""},{""text1"":""Chapter 7""},{""text1"":""By\nWaughin Jarth""},{""text1"":""\nScene: Silvenar, Valenwood\nDate: 13 Sun's Dusk, 3E 397""},{""text1"":""The banquet at the palace of the Silvenar was well attended by every jealous bureaucrat and trader who had attempted to contract the rebuilding of Valenwood.  They looked on Decumus Scotti, Liodes Jurus, and Basth with undisguised hatred.  It made Scotti very uncomfortable, but Jurus delighted in it.  As the servants brought in platter after platter of roasted meats, Jurus poured himself a cup of Jagga and toasted the clerk.""},{""text1"":""\""I can confess it now,\"" said Jurus. \""I had grave doubts about inviting you to join me on this adventure.  All the other clerks and agents of building commissions I contacted were more outwardly aggressive, but none of them made it through, let alone to the audience chamber of the Silvenar, let alone brokered the deals on their own like you did.  Come, have a cup of Jagga with me.\""""},{""text1"":""\""No thank you,\"" said Scotti. \""I had too much of that drug in Falinesti, and nearly got sucked dry by a giant tick because of it.  I'll find something else to drink.\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti wandered about the hall until he saw some diplomats drinking mugs of a steaming brown liquid, poured from a large silver urn.  He asked them if it was tea.""},{""text1"":""\""Tea made from leaves?\"" scoffed the first diplomat. \""Not in Valenwood.  This is Rotmeth.\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti poured himself a mug and took a tentative sip.  It was gamy, bitter and sugared, and very salty.  At first it seemed very disagreeable to his palate, but a moment later he found he had drained the mug and was pouring another.  His body tingled.  All the sounds in the chamber seemed oddly disjointed, but not frighteningly so.""},{""text1"":""\""So you're the fellow who got the Silvenar to sign all those contracts,\"" said the second diplomat. \""That must have required some deep negotiation.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Not at all, not at all, just a little basic understand of mercantile trading,\"" grinned Scotti, pouring himself a third mug of Rotmeth. \""The Silvenar was very eager to involve the Imperial state with the affairs of Valenwood.  I was very eager to take a percentage of the commission.  With all that blessed eagerness, it was merely a matter of putting quill to contract, bless you.\""""},{""text1"":""\""You have been in the employ of his Imperial Majesty very long?\"" asked the first diplomat.""},{""text1"":""\""It's a bite, or rather, a bit more complicated than that in the Imperial City.  Between you and me, I don't really have a job.  I used to work for Lord Atrius and his Building Commission, but I got sacked.  And then, the contracts are from Lord Vanech and his Building Commission, 'cause I got em from this fellow Reglius who is a competitor but still a very fine fellow until he was made dead by those Khajiiti,\"" Scotti drained his fifth mug. \""When I go back to the Imperial City, then the real negotiations can begin, bless you.  I can go to my old employer and to Lord Vanech, and say, look here you, which one of you wants these commissions?  And they'll fall over each other to take them from me.  It will be bidding war for my percentage the likes of which no one nowhere has never seen.\""""},{""text1"":""\""So you're not a representative of his Imperial Majesty, the Emperor?\"" asked the first diplomat.""},{""text1"":""\""Didn't you hear what I'm said? You stupid?\"" Scotti felt a surge of rage, which quickly subsided.  He chuckled, and poured himself a seventh mug. \""The Building Commissions are privately owned, but they're still representatives of the Emperor.  So I'm a representative of the Emperor.  Or I will be.  When I get these contracts in.  It's very complicated.  I can understand why you're not following me.  Bless you, it's all like the poet said, a dance in fire, if you follow the illusion, that is to say, allusion.\""""},{""text1"":""\""And your colleagues?  Are they representatives of the Emperor?\"" asked the second diplomat.""},{""text1"":""Scotti burst into laughter, shaking his head.  The diplomats bade him their respects and went to talk to the Minister.  Scotti stumbled out of the palace, and reeled through the strange, organic avenues and boulevards of the city.  It took him several hours to find his way to Prithala Hall and his room.  Once there, he slept, very nearly on his bed.""},{""text1"":""The next morning, he woke to Jurus and Basth in his room, shaking him.  He felt half-asleep and unable to open his eyes fully, but otherwise fine.  The conversation with the diplomats floated in his mind in a haze, like an obscure childhood memory.""},{""text1"":""\""What in Mara's name is Rotmeth?\"" he asked quickly.""},{""text1"":""\""Rancid, strongly fermented meat juices with lots of spices to kill the poisons,\"" smiled Basth. \""I should have warned you to stay with Jagga.\""""},{""text1"":""\""You must understand the Meat Mandate by now,\"" laughed Jurus. \""These Bosmeri would rather eat each other than touch the fruit of the vine or the field.\""""},{""text1"":""\""What did I say to those diplomats?\"" cried Scotti, panicking.""},{""text1"":""\""Nothing bad apparently,\"" said Jurus, pulling out some papers. \""Your escorts are downstairs to bring you to the Imperial Province.  Here are your papers of safe passage.  The Silvenar seems very impatient about business proceeding forward rapidly.  He promises to send you some sort of rare treasure when the contracts are fulfilled.  See, he's already given me something.\""""},{""text1"":""Jurus showed off his new, bejeweled earring, a beautiful large faceted ruby.  Basth showed that he had a similar one.  The two fat fellows left the room so Scotti could dress and pack.""},{""text1"":""A full regiment of the Silvenar's guards was on the street in front of the tavern.  They surrounded a carriage crested with the official arms of Valenwood.  Still dazed, Scotti climbed in, and the captain of the guard gave the signal.  They began a quick gallop.  Scotti shook himself, and then peered behind.  Basth and Jurus were waving him goodbye.""},{""text1"":""\""Wait!\"" Scotti cried. \""Aren't you coming back to the Imperial Province too?\""""},{""text1"":""\""The Silvenar asked that we stay behind as Imperial representatives!\"" yelled Liodes Jurus. \""In case there's a need for more contracts and negotiations!  He's appointed us Undrape, some sort of special honor for foreigners at court!  Don't worry!  Lots of banquets to attend!  You can handle the negotiations with Vanech and Atrius yourself and we'll keep things settled here!\""""},{""text1"":""Jurus continued to yell advice about business, but his voice became indistinct with distance.  Soon it disappeared altogether as the convoy rounded the streets of Silvenar.  The jungle loomed suddenly and then they were in it.  Scotti had only gone through it by foot or along the rivers by slow-moving boats.  Now it flashed all around him in profusions of greens.  The horses seemed even faster moving through underbrush than on the smooth paths of the city.  None of the weird sounds or dank smells of the jungle penetrated the escort.  It felt to Scotti as if he were watching a play about the jungle with a background of a quickly moving scrim, which offered only the merest suggestion of the place.""},{""text1"":""So it went for two weeks.  There was lots of food and water in the carriage with the clerk, so he merely ate and slept as the caravan pressed endlessly on.  From time to time, he'd hear the sound of blades clashing, but when he looked around whatever had attacked the caravan had long since been left behind.  At last, they reached the border, where an Imperial garrison was stationed.""},{""text1"":""Scotti presented the soldiers who met the carriage with the papers.  They asked him a barrage of questions that he answered monosyllabically, and then let him pass.  It took several more days to arrive at the gates of the Imperial City.  The horses that had flown so fast through the jungle now slowed down in the unfamiliar territory of the wooded Colovian Estates.  By contrast, the cries of his province's birds and smells of his province's plant life brought Decumus Scotti alive.  It was if he had been dreaming all the past months.""},{""text1"":""At the gates of the City, Scotti's carriage door was opened for him and he stepped out on uncertain legs.  Before he had a moment to say something to the escort, they had vanished, galloping back south through the forest.  The first thing he did now that he was home was go to the closest tavern and have tea and fruit and bread.  If he never ate meat again, he told himself, that would suit him very nicely.""},{""text1"":""Negotiations with Lord Atrius and Lord Vanech proceeded immediately thereafter.  It was most agreeable.  Both commissions recognized how lucrative the rebuilding of Valenwood would be for their agency.  Lord Vanech claimed, quite justifiably, that as the contracts had been written on forms notarized by his commission, he had the legal right to them.  Lord Atrius claimed that Decumus Scotti was his agent and representative, and that he had never been released from employment.  The Emperor was called to arbitrate, but he claimed to be unavailable.  His advisor, the Imperial Battlemage Jagar Tharn, had disappeared long ago and could not be called on for his wisdom and impartial mediation.""},{""text1"":""Scotti lived very comfortably off the bribes from Lord Atrius and Lord Vanech.  Every week, a letter would arrive from Jurus or Basth asking about the status of negotiations.  Gradually, these letters ceased coming, and more urgent ones came from the Minister of Trade and the Silvenar himself.  The War of the Blue Divide with Summurset Isle ended with the Altmeri winning several new coastal islands from the Wood Elves.  The war with Elsweyr continued, ravaging the eastern borders of Valenwood.  Still, Vanech and Atrius fought over who would help.""},{""text1"":""One fine morning in the early spring of the year 3E 398, a courier arrived at Decumus Scotti's door.""},{""text1"":""\""Lord Vanech has won the Valenwood commission, and requests that you and the contracts come to his hall at your earliest convenience.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Has Lord Atrius decided not to challenge further?\"" asked Scotti.""},{""text1"":""\""He's been unable to, having died very suddenly, just now, from a terribly unfortunate accident,\"" said the courier.""},{""text1"":""Scotti had wondered how long it would be before the Dark Brotherhood was brought in for final negotiations.  As he walked toward Lord Vanech's Building Commission, a long, severe piece of architecture on a minor but respectable plaza, he wondered if he had played the game, as he ought to have.  Could Vanech be so rapacious as to offer him a lower percentage of the commission now that his chief competitor was dead?  Thankfully, he discovered, Lord Vanech had already decided to pay Scotti what he had proposed during the heat of the winter negotiations.  His advisors had explained to him that other, lesser building commissions might come forward unless the matter were handled quickly and fairly.""},{""text1"":""\""Glad we have all the legal issues done with,\"" said Lord Vanech, fondly. \""Now we can get to the business of helping the poor Bosmeri, and collecting the profits.  It's a pity you weren't our representative for all the troubles with Bend'r-mahk and the Arnesian business.  But there will be plenty more wars, I'm sure of that.\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti and Lord Vanech sent word to the Silvenar that at last they were prepared to honor the contracts.  A few weeks later, they held a banquet in honor of the profitable enterprise.  Decumus Scotti was the darling of the Imperial City, and no expense was spared to make it an unforgettable evening.""},{""text1"":""As Scotti met the nobles and wealthy merchants who would be benefiting from his business dealings, an exotic but somehow faintly familiar smell rose in the ballroom.  He traced it to its source: a thick roasted slab of meat, so long and thick it covered several platters.  The Cyrodilic revelers were eating it ravenously, unable to find the words to express their delight at its taste and texture.""},{""text1"":""\""It's like nothing I've ever had before!\""""},{""text1"":""\""It's like pig-fed venison!\""""},{""text1"":""\""Do you see the marbling of fat and meat?  It's a masterpiece!\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti went to take a slice, but then he saw something imbedded deep in the dried and rendered roast.  He nearly collided with his new employer Lord Vanech as he stumbled back.""},{""text1"":""\""Where did this come from?\"" Scotti stammered.""},{""text1"":""\""From our client, the Silvenar,\"" beamed his lordship. \""It's some kind of local delicacy they call Unthrappa.\""""},{""text1"":""Scotti vomited, and didn't stop for some time.  It cast rather a temporary pall on the evening, but when Decumus Scotti was carried off to his manor house, the guests continued to dine.  The Unthrappa was the delight of all.  Even more so when Lord Vanech himself took a slice and found the first of two rubies buried within.  How very clever of the Bosmer to invent such a dish, the Cyrodiils agreed.""}]"

Born to the Imperial Family in the sixty-seventh year of the third era, Potema was immediately presented to her grandfather, the Emperor Uriel Septim II, a famously kindhearted man, who viewed the solemn, intense babe and whispered, \""She looks like a she-wolf about ready to pounce.\""""},{""text1"":""Potema's childhood in the Imperial City was certainly difficult from the start.  Her father, Prince Pelagius Septim, and her mother, Qizara, showed little affection for their brood.  Her eldest brother Antiochus, sixteen at Potema's birth, was already a drunkard and womanizer, infamous in the empire.  Her younger brothers Cephorus and Magnus were born much later, so for years she was the only child in the Imperial Court.""},{""text1"":""By the age of 14, Potema was a famous beauty with many suitors, but she was married to cement relations with King Mantiarco of the Nordic kingdom of Solitude.  She entered the court, it was said, as a pawn, but she quickly became a queen.  The elderly King Mantiarco loved her and allowed her all the power she wished, which was total.""},{""text1"":""When Uriel Septim II died the following year, her father was made emperor, and he faced a greatly depleted treasury, thanks to his father's poor management.  Pelagius II dismissed the Elder Council, forcing them to buy back their positions.  In 3E 97, after many miscarriages, the Queen of Solitude gave birth to a son, who she named Uriel after her grandfather.  Mantiarco quickly made Uriel his heir, but the Queen had much larger ambitions for her child.""},{""text1"":""Two years later, Pelagius II died -- many say poisoned by a vengeful former Council member -- and his son, Potema's brother Antiochus took the throne.  At age forty-eight, it could be said that Antiochus's wild seeds had yet to be sown, and the history books are nearly pornographic in their depictions of life at the Imperial court during the years of his reign.  Potema, whose passion was for power not fornication, was scandalized every time she visited the Imperial City.""},{""text1"":""Mantiarco, King of Solitude, died the springtide after Pelagius II.  Uriel ascended to the throne, ruling jointly with his mother.  Doubtless, Uriel had the right and would have preferred to rule alone, but Potema convinced him that his position was only temporary.  He would have the Empire, not merely the kingdom.  In Castle Solitude, she entertained dozens of diplomats from other kingdoms of Skyrim, sowing seeds of discontent.  Her guest list over the years expanded to include kings and queens of High Rock and Morrowind as well.""},{""text1"":""For thirteen years, Antiochus ruled Tamriel, and proved an able leader despite his moral laxity.  Several historians point to proof that Potema cast the spell that ended her brother's life, but evidence one way or another is lost in the sands of time.  In any event, both she and her son Uriel were visiting the Imperial court in 3E 112 when Antiochus died, and immediately challenged the rule of his daughter and heir, Kintyra.""},{""text1"":""Potema's speech to the Elder Council is perhaps helpful to students of public speaking.""},{""text1"":""She began with flattery and self-abasement: \""My most august and wise friends, members of the Elder Council, I am but a provincial queen, and I can only assume to bring to issue what you yourselves must have already pondered.\""""},{""text1"":""She continued on to praise the late Emperor, who was a popular ruler in spite of his flaws:  \""He was a true Septim and a great warrior, destroying -- with your counsel -- the near invincible armada of Pyandonea.\""""},{""text1"":""But little time was wasted, before she came to her point: \""The Empress Magna unfortunately did nothing to temper my brother's lustful spirits.

was fully occupied with what I should wear on my wedding day.\""""},{""text1"":""\""You have been out of the right society for very long now,\"" frowned her friend Khargol approvingly. \""You never told me what happened to your first husband, you know, the one the shaman gave you?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Torn apart by ash ghouls,\"" smiled Kepkajna dreamily. \""It was rather saddish.  But I know nothing like that would happen to Wodworg.  No life of adventure for him.  He's practically an Imperial.  In fact, he is one.  Did I tell you how we met?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Hundreds of times,\"" grumbled Khargol, reaching for his flagon. \""He was your jailer, and he refused you food until you promised to marry him.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Have you ever heard of anything so madly romantic in all your life?\"" sighed Kepkajna, and then grew serious. \""I was going to say that I hope my old friends will wish me well, but as Old Bosriel used to say, there's no point in hoping for what cannot be.  We'll leave with the Imperial Knights for Balmora immediately after the wedding, but as long as we're in Dagon Fel, the gang will find some way of disrupting my love life and bring me back to the light.  I know it.\""""},{""text1"":""As the days approached towards the Wraith's wedding day, there was certainly something sinister in the air that Kepkajna could smell when she was not transported by heady bliss.  Dark figures seemed to shift in the shadows and disappear when approached.  She recognized the clothing of some beggars near Wodworg's cottage as costumes, but the mendicants hurried away before she could recognize which of her old gang was stalking her.""},{""text1"":""But these moments of apprehension were few.  Kepkajna was truly happy, making arrangements for the ceremony to be performed at the very dungeon where Wodworg had imprisoned her.  Her father was long since dead -- another victim of the ash ghouls -- but her fiance's commander volunteered to act in his behalf.  Of course, Kepkajna had to supply her own dowry.  She spent every last mark of her savings of ill-gotten gain to buy her beloved a truly wonderful present.""},{""text1"":""The wedding was set for the stroke of midnight, as is Orc tradition.  The handmaidens, wives of Imperial officers, were busily sewing her into her gown of red velvet and fine gold filigree in the mid-morning.  Dolcetta, one of the handmaidens, remarked that she had heard that Kepkajna had bought Wodworg a truly beautiful gift for her dowry.""},{""text1"":""\""Let me show it to you,\"" Kepkajna giggled, dashing from the room half-dressed to her hidden alcove.  The present had been stolen.""},{""text1"":""The women were horrified, but the Wraith found herself merely irritated, not surprised.  This was truly the old gang's style.  They knew that a wedding ceremony without a dowry was marked as unlucky.  She asked her handmaidens to finish dressing her quickly while she pondered what the burglars would have done with her treasure.""},{""text1"":""The whole region was honeycombed with secret lairs and abandoned sites thieves used to store their loot.  There were obvious places, of course, but after much reflection, she thought of where she would have put it under similar circumstances.  Once the handmaids had finished, Kepkajna bade them to make certain that the ceremony went on as scheduled, and not to fret as she might be a little late.  She wrapped herself in a shawl to protect her gown from dungeon dust and set off for the Shrine of Malacath.""},{""text1"":""The Wraith had never before attempted to rob her own friends, and though she was peeved at them for trying to ruin her happiness, she had no interest in hurting them physically.  Her style was to avoid conflict, though she knew it would be inevitable.  The lessons her mentor Khargol had given her had helped her avoid the lances and blades of guards and Imperial Knights over the years: now she would see if they would allow her to survive a den of thieves and the unknown dangers of the Shrine.  Without, most importantly, ruining her dress.""},{""text1"":""The desolate place was so empty as she delved into it that she feared she might have made a miscalculation.  It was not until she found the small room hidden down a long corridor that she knew she was at the right place, and that it was well suited for an ambush.  She grabbed the chest with her treasure within, and turned to face the assault.""},{""text1"":""Two of her old gang, Yorum and Yohr-i the Redguard twin brother and sister, were outside the door as she came from the room.  They knew the Wraith better than to taunt her and immediately attacked.  Yorum struck out with a left thrust of his blade while Yohr-i sought to rush her.  The Wraith neatly sidestepped Yohr-i, while dropping her weight to her rear left leg, shifting her right shoulder to the left to slip past Yorum's strike.  The twins crashed into one another and Kepkajna passed swiftly on.""},{""text1"":""Almost immediately, she was set on by the Argonian Binyaar, his mace whistling through the air at her head.  They had never much liked one another.  The Wraith snapped into a duck, so the mace whacked with a tremendous clamor against the stone wall.  Binyaar was thrown off balance, giving her a few seconds lead hurrying up the passage.  Ahead she could smell the fresh night air.""},{""text1"":""The last of her dowry's defenders was Sorogth, an Orc with whom she had shared a brief romance.  It was he who Kepkajna knew had masterminded the theft.  In a way and in context, she thought, his devotion to her misery was rather sweet.  At the moment, though, she was most concerned with avoiding his barbed ax that seemed ideal for breaking her dress's fine stitchwork and the flesh beneath.""},{""text1"":""Bending her knees slightly, bobbing to avoid strikes to the head, weaving her head to confuse Sorogth of her next move, shuffling her feet arrhythmically, the Wraith made an impossible target.  She ducked inside his thrusts, sidestepped his swings, and then sidestepped his thrusts, and ducked his swings.  As erratic as she tried to make her defensive moves, Sorogth still kept pace with her, refusing to budge from his position at the dungeon outlet.""},{""text1"":""Midnight was coming, and the Wraith finally decided that she must end the confrontation.  When Sorogth swung out next, she sidestepped to her left, swayed down, and ducked her head, so the ax whistled over her right shoulder.  In that instant, his right side was exposed, and she reluctantly smashed the chest hard into his torso.  There was not enough time for Kepkajna to see if she had killed him or merely knocked him unconscious.  In truth, she thought of nothing else but rushing to her wedding ceremony.""},{""text1"":""At precisely midnight, Wodworg and Kepkajna were united together.  He was delighted with her dowry gift, a fine suit of armor that would make him the envy of other Imperial jailers.  Even more, he was enchanted by his wife's tale of retrieving it from the Shrine of Malacath.""},{""text1"":""\""Did it occur to you to put on the armor when you knew that it was an ambush?\"" he asked.""},{""text1"":""\""I didn't want to dent your present,\"" she replied, between kisses. \""And I certainly didn't want to wrinkle my gown.\""""}]"

It wasn't perhaps for the best of motivations, but Gorgos decided to go to the Guild and get the quill enchanted.""},{""text"":""The Mages Guild was not then, especially not then, an elitist institution, as I have said, but when the messenger boy came in and asked to use the Itemmaker, he was greeted with some suspicion.

Because of all the gold he gave to the Guild, Gorgos could infuse the quill with the highest-price soul available, which was something daedric called Feyfolken.  The initiate at the Guild, being ignorant as most Guildmembers were at that time, did not know very much about the spirit except that it was filled with energy. When Gorgos left the room, the quill had been enchanted to its very limit and then some.

However, the story does touch on some issues of the natures of spirits and thus is related to conjuration, so I'll continue.""},{""text"":""Thaurbad began using the quill to write the Temple Bulletin, and there was something about the slightly lopsided, almost three-dimensional quality of the letters that Thaurbad liked a lot.""},{""text"":""Into the night, Thaurbad put together the Temple of Auri-El's Bulletin. For the moment he washed over the page with the Feyfolken quill, it became a work of art, an illuminated manuscript crafted of gold, but with good, simple and strong vernacular. The sermon excerpts read like poetry, despite being based on the archpriest's workmanlike exhortation of the most banal of the Alessian doctrines. The obituaries of two of the Temple's chief benefactors were stark and powerful, pitifully mundane deaths transitioned into world-class tragedies. Thaurbad worked the magical palette until he nearly fainted from exhaustion. At six o'clock in the morning, a day before deadline, he handed the Bulletin to Gorgos for him to carry to Alfiers, the Temple secretary.""},{""text"":""As expected, Alfiers never wrote back to compliment him or even comment on how early he had sent the bulletin. It didn't matter. Thaurbad knew it was the best Bulletin the Temple had ever posted. At one o'clock on Sundas, Gorgos brought him many messages.""},{""text"":""\""The Bulletin today was so beautiful, when I read it in the vestibule, I'm ashamed to tell you I wept copiously,\"" wrote the archpriest. \""I don't think I've seen anything that captures Auri-El's glory so beautifully before. The cathedrals of Firsthold pale in comparison. My friend, I prostrate myself before the greatest artist since Gallael.\""""},{""text"":""The archpriest was, like most men of the cloth, given to hyperbole. Still, Thaurbad was happy with the compliment. More messages followed. All of the Temple Elders and thirty-three of the parishioners young and old had all taken the time to find out who wrote the bulletin and how to get a message to congratulate him. And there was only one person they could go through for that information: Alfiers. Imaging the dragon lady besieged by his admirers filled Thaurbad with positive glee.""},{""text"":""He was still in a good mood the next day when he took the ferry to his appointment with his healer, Telemichiel. The herbalist was new, a pretty Redguard woman who tried to talk to him, even after he gave her the note reading \""My name is Thaurbad Hulzik and I have an appointment with Telemichiel for eleven o'clock. Please forgive me for not talking, but I have no voicebox anymore.\""""},{""text"":""\""Has it started raining yet?\"" she asked cheerfully. \""The diviner said it might.\""""},{""text"":""Thaurbad frowned and shook his head angrily. Why was it that everyone thought that mute people liked to be talked to? Did soldiers who lost their arms like to be thrown balls? It was undoubtedly not a purposefully cruel behavior, but Thaurbad still suspected that some people just liked to prove that they weren't crippled too.""},{""text"":""The examination itself was routine horror. Telemichiel performed the regular invasive torture, all the while chatting and chatting and chatting.""},{""text"":""\""You ought to try talking once in a while.  That's the only way to see if you're getting better.  If you don't feel comfortable doing it in public, you could try practicing it by yourself,\"" said Telemichiel, knowing her patient would ignore her advice. \""Try singing in the bath. You'll probably find you don't sound as bad as you think.\""""},{""text"":""Thaurbad left the examination with the promise of test results in a couple of weeks. On the ferry ride back home, Thaurbad began thinking of next week's temple bulletin. What about a double-border around the \""Last Sundas's Offering Plate\"" announcement? Putting the sermon in two columns instead of one might have interesting effects. It was almost unbearable to think that he couldn't get started on it until Alfiers sent him information.""},{""text"":""When she did, it was with the note, \""LAST BULLETIN A LITTLE BETTER. NEXT TIME, DON'T USE THE WORD 'FORTUITOUS' IN PLACE OF 'FORTUNATE.' THE WORDS ARE NOT, IF YOU LOOK THEM UP, SYNONYMOUS.\""""},{""text"":""In response, Thaurbad almost followed Telemichiel's advice by screaming obscenities at Gorgos. Instead, he drank a bottle of cheap wine, composed and sent a suitable reply, and fell asleep on the floor.""},{""text"":""The next morning, after a long bath, Thaurbad began work on the Bulletin. His idea for putting a light shading effect on the \""Special Announcements\"" section had an amazing textural effect. Alfiers always hated the extra decorations he added to the borders, but using the Feyfolken quill, they looked strangely powerful and majestic.""},{""text"":""Gorgos came to him with a message from Alfiers at that very moment as if in response to the thought. Thaurbad opened it up.  It simply said, \""I'M SORRY.\""""},{""text"":""Thaurbad kept working. Alfiers's note he put from his mind, sure that she would soon follow it up with the complete message \""I'M SORRY THAT NO ONE EVER TAUGHT YOU TO KEEP RIGHT-HAND AND LEFT-HAND MARGINS THE SAME LENGTH\"" or \""I'M SORRY WE CAN'T GET SOMEONE OTHER THAN A WEIRD, OLD MAN AS SCRIBE OF OUR BULLETIN.\"" It didn't matter what she was sorry about. The columns from the sermon notes rose like the massive pillars of roses, crowned with unashamedly ornate headers. The obituaries and birth announcements were framed together with a spherical border, as a heartbreaking declaration of the circle of life. The Bulletin was simultaneously both warm and avant-garde. It was a masterpiece. When he sent it off to Alfiers late that afternoon, he knew she'd hate it, and was glad.""},{""text"":""Thaurbad was surprised to get a message from the Temple on Loredas. Before he read the content, he could tell from the style that it wasn't from Alfiers. The handwriting wasn't Alfiers's usual belligerent slashing style, and it wasn't all in Alfiers's usual capital letters, which read like a scream from Oblivion.""},{""text"":""\""Thaurbad, I thought you should know Alfiers isn't at the Temple anymore. She quit her position yesterday, very suddenly. My name is Vanderthil, and I was lucky enough (let me admit it now, I begged pitifully) to be your new Temple contact. I'm overwhelmed by your genius. I was having a crisis of faith until I read last week's Bulletin. This week's Bulletin is a miracle. Enough. I just wanted to say I'm honored to be working with you. -- Vanderthil.\""""},{""text"":""The response on Sundas after the service even astonished Thaurbad. The archpriest attributed the massive increase in attendance and collection plate offerings entirely to the Bulletin. Thaurbad's salary was quadrupled. Gorgos brought over a hundred and twenty messages from his adoring public.""},{""text"":""The following week, Thaurbad sat in front of his writing plank, a glass of fine Torvali mead at his side, staring at the blank scroll. He had no ideas. The Bulletin, his child, his second-wife, bored him. The third-rate sermons of the archbishop were absolute anathema, and the deaths and births of the Temple patrons struck him as entirely pointless. Blah blah, he thought as he scribbled on the page.""},{""text"":""He knew he wrote the letters B-L-A-H B-L-A-H. The words that appeared on the scroll were, \""A necklace of pearl on a white neck.\""""},{""text"":""He scrawled a jagged line across the page. It appeared in through that damned beautiful Feyfolken quill: \""Glory to Auri-El.\""""},{""text"":""Thaurbad slammed the quill and poetry spilled forth in a stream of ink. He scratched over the page, blotting over everything, and the vanquished words sprung back up in different form, even more exquisite than before. Every daub and splatter caused the document to whirl like a kaleidoscope before falling together in gorgeous asymmetry. There was nothing he could do to ruin the Bulletin. Feyfolken had taken over. He was a reader, not an author.""},{""text"":""Now,\"" asked the Great Sage. \""What was Feyfolken from your knowledge of the School of Conjuration?\""""},{""text"":""\""What happened next?\"" cried Vonguldak.""},{""text"":""\""First, tell me what Feyfolken was, and then I'll continue the story.\""""},{""text"":""\""You said it was a daedra,\"" said Taksim. \""And it seems to have something to do with artistic expression.  Was Feyfolken a servitor of Azura?\""""},{""text"":""\""But the scribe may have been imagining all this,\"" said Vonguldak. \""Perhaps Feyfolken is a servitor of Sheogorath, and he's gone mad.

With a cry, he snapped the quill in half.""},{""text"":""He turned to finish his glass of mead.  When he turned around, the quill was intact.""},{""text"":""He had no other quills but the one he had enchanted, so he dipped his finger in the inkwell and wrote a note to Gorgos in big sloppy letters.  When Gorgos returned with a new batch of congratulatory messages from the Temple, praising his latest Bulletin, he handed the note and the quill to the messenger boy.  The note read: \""Take the quill back to the Mages Guild and sell it.  Buy me another quill with no enchantments.\""""},{""text"":""Gorgos didn't know what to make of the note, but he did as he was told.  He returned a few hours later.""},{""text"":""\""They wouldn't give us any gold back for it,\"" said Gorgos. \""They said it wasn't enchanted.  I told 'em, I said 'What are you talking about, you enchanted it right here with that Feyfolken soul gem,' and they said, 'Well, there ain't a soul in it now.  Maybe you did something and it got loose.'\""""},{""text"":""Gorgos paused to look at his master.  Thaurbad couldn't speak, of course, but he seemed even more than usually speechless.""},{""text"":""\""Anyway, I threw the quill away and got you this new one, like you said.\""""},{""text"":""Thaurbad studied the new quill.  It was white-feathered while his old quill had been dove gray. It felt good in his hand.  He sighed with relief and waved his messenger lad away.  He had a Bulletin to write, and this time, without any magic except for his own talent.""},{""text"":""Within two days time, he was nearly back on schedule. It looked plain but it was entirely his. Thaurbad felt a strange reassurance when he ran his eyes over the page and noticed some slight errors. It had been a long time since the Bulletin contained any errors. In fact, Thaurbad reflected happily, there were probably other mistakes still in the document that he was not seeing.""},{""text"":""He was finishing a final whirl of plain calligraphy on the borders when Gorgos arrived with some messages from the Temple. He looked through them all quickly, until one caught his eye.  The wax seal on the letter read \""Feyfolken.\""  With complete bafflement, he broke it open.""},{""text"":""\""I think you should kill yourself,\"" it read in perfectly gorgeous script.""},{""text"":""He dropped the letter to the floor, seeing sudden movement on the Bulletin.  Feyfolken script leapt from the letter and coursed over the scroll in a flood, translating his shabby document into a work of sublime beauty. Thaurbad no longer cared about the weird croaking quality of his voice. He screamed for a very long time. And then drank. Heavily.""},{""text"":""Gorgos brought Thaurbad a message from Vanderthil, the secretary of the Temple, early Fredas morning, but it took the scribe until mid-morning to work up the courage to look at it. \""Good Morning, I am just checking in on the Bulletin. You usually have it in on Turdas night. I'm curious. You planning something special? -- Vanderthil.\""""},{""text"":""Thaurbad responded, \""Vanderthil, I'm sorry. I've been sick. There won't be a Bulletin this Sunday\"" and handed the note to Gorgos before retiring to his bath.  When he came back an hour later, Gorgos was just returning from the Temple, smiling.""},{""text"":""\""Vanderthil and the archpriest went crazy,\"" he said. \""They said it was your best work ever.\""""},{""text"":""Thaurbad looked at Gorgos, uncomprehending.  Then he noticed that the Bulletin was gone.  Shaking, he dipped his finger in the inkwell and scrawled the words \""What did the note I sent with you say?\""""},{""text"":""\""You don't remember?\"" asked Gorgos, holding back a smile.  He knew the master had been drinking a lot lately.  \""I don't remember the exact words, but it was something like, 'Vanderthil, here it is. Sorry it's late. I've been having severe mental problems lately. - Thaurbad.'  Since you said, 'here it is,' I figured you wanted me to bring the Bulletin along, so I did.  And like I said, they loved it.  I bet you get three times as much letters this Sundas.\""""},{""text"":""Thaurbad nodded his head, smiled, and waved the messenger lad away.  Gorgos returned back to the Temple, while his master turned to his writing plank, and pulled out a fresh sheet of parchment.""},{""text"":""He wrote with the quill: \""What do you want, Feyfolken?\""""},{""text"":""The words became: \""Goodbye. I hate my life. I have cut my wrists.\""""},{""text"":""Thaurbad tried another tact: \""Have I gone insane?\""""},{""text"":""The words became: \""Goodbye. I have poison.

That's why I've put this noose around my neck.\""""},{""text"":""Thaurbad picked up a fresh parchment, dipped his finger in the inkwell, and proceeded to rewrite the entire Bulletin. While his original draft, before Feyfolken had altered it, had been simple and flawed, the new copy was a scrawl. Lower-case I's were undotted, G's looked like Y's, sentences ran into margins and curled up and all over like serpents. Ink from the first page leaked onto the second page. When he yanked the pages from the notebook, a long tear nearly divided the third page in half. Something about the final result was evocative. Thaurbad at least hoped so. He wrote another note reading, simply, \""Use this Bulletin instead of the piece of trash I sent you.\""""},{""text"":""When Gorgos returned with new messages, Thaurbad handed the envelope to him.  The new letters were all the same, except for one from his healer, Telemichiel. \""Thaurbad, we need you to come in as soon as possible. We've received the reports from Black Marsh about a strain of the Crimson Plague that sounds very much like your disease, and we need to re-examine you. Nothing is definite yet, but we're going to want to see what our options are.\""""},{""text"":""It took Thaurbad the rest of the day and fifteen drams of the stoutest mead to recover. The larger part of the next morning was spent recovering from this means of recovery. He started to write a message to Vanderthil: \""What did you think of the new Bulletin?\"" with the quill.  Feyfolken's improved version was \""I'm going to ignite myself on fire, because I'm a dying no-talent.\""""},{""text"":""Thaurbad rewrote the note using his finger-and-ink message.  When Gorgos appeared, he handed him the note.  There was one message in Vanderthil's handwriting.""},{""text"":""It read, \""Thaurbad, not only are you divinely inspired, but you have a great sense of humor.  Imagine us using those scribbles you sent instead of the real Bulletin.  You made the archbishop laugh heartily.  I cannot wait to see what you have next week.  Yours fondly, Vanderthil.\""""},{""text"":""The funeral service a week later brought out far more friends and admirers than Thaurbad Hulzik would've believed possible. The coffin, of course, had to be closed, but that didn't stop the mourners from filing into lines to touch its smooth oak surface, imagining it as the flesh of the artist himself. The archbishop managed to rise to the occasion and deliver a better than usual eulogy. Thaurbad's old nemesis, the secretary before Vanderthil, Alfiers came in from Cloudrest, wailing and telling all who would listen that Thaurbad's suggestions had changed the direction of her life. When she heard Thaurbad had left her his quill in his final testament, she broke down in tears. Vanderthil was even more inconsolable, until she found a handsome and delightfully single young man.""},{""text"":""\""I can hardly believe he's gone and I never even saw him face-to-face or spoke to him,\"" she said. \""I saw the body, but even if he hadn't been all burned up, I wouldn't have been able to tell if it was him or not.\""""},{""text"":""\""I wish I could tell you there'd been a mistake, but there was plenty of medical evidence,\"" said Telemichiel. \""I supplied some of it myself.

He used several of the books in his current lecture, explaining to his students, Taksim and Vonguldak, how the Mages Guild had first been founded by Vanus Galerion.  They had many questions about Galerion's beginnings in the Psijic Order, and how the study of magic there differed from the Mages Guild.""},{""text1"":""\""It was, and is, a very structured way of life,\"" explained the Great Sage. \""Quite elitist, actually.

No one had a good reason to keep in touch with Thaurbad Hulzik, and in time, very few even tried.  His sister-in-law sent him the occasional letter with news of people he could barely remember, but even that communication was rare.

The truth was, he didn't need to do it anymore.  He had quite a fortune stashed away, but he didn't have anything else to occupy his days.

It was virtually quivering with power.""},{""text1"":""Of course, when Thaurbad used it, that's when it became clear how over his head he was.""},{""text1"":""And now,\"" said the Great Sage. \""It's time for your test.\""""},{""text1"":""\""But what happened?  What were the quill's powers?\"" cried Taksim.""},{""text1"":""\""You can't stop the tale there!\"" objected Vonguldak.""},{""text1"":""\""We will continue the tale after your conjuration test, provided you both perform exceptionally well,\"" said the Great Sage.\n ""},{""text1"":""Feyfolken""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""Book Two""},{""text1"":""\nby\nWaughin Jarth""},{""text1"":""\nAfter the test had been given and Vonguldak and Taksim had demonstrated their knowledge of elementary conjuration, the Great Sage told them that they were free to enjoy the day.

However, the story does touch on some issues of the natures of spirits and thus is related to conjuration, so I'll continue.""},{""text1"":""Thaurbad began using the quill to write the Temple Bulletin, and there was something about the slightly lopsided, almost three-dimensional quality of the letters that Thaurbad liked a lot.""},{""text1"":""Into the night, Thaurbad put together the Temple of Auri-El's Bulletin. For the moment he washed over the page with the Feyfolken quill, it became a work of art, an illuminated manuscript crafted of gold, but with good, simple and strong vernacular. The sermon excerpts read like poetry, despite being based on the archpriest's workmanlike exhortation of the most banal of the Alessian doctrines. The obituaries of two of the Temple's chief benefactors were stark and powerful, pitifully mundane deaths transitioned into world-class tragedies. Thaurbad worked the magical palette until he nearly fainted from exhaustion. At six o'clock in the morning, a day before deadline, he handed the Bulletin to Gorgos for him to carry to Alfiers, the Temple secretary.""},{""text1"":""As expected, Alfiers never wrote back to compliment him or even comment on how early he had sent the bulletin. It didn't matter. Thaurbad knew it was the best Bulletin the Temple had ever posted. At one o'clock on Sundas, Gorgos brought him many messages.""},{""text1"":""\""The Bulletin today was so beautiful, when I read it in the vestibule, I'm ashamed to tell you I wept copiously,\"" wrote the archpriest. \""I don't think I've seen anything that captures Auri-El's glory so beautifully before. The cathedrals of Firsthold pale in comparison. My friend, I prostrate myself before the greatest artist since Gallael.\""""},{""text1"":""The archpriest was, like most men of the cloth, given to hyperbole. Still, Thaurbad was happy with the compliment. More messages followed. All of the Temple Elders and thirty-three of the parishioners young and old had all taken the time to find out who wrote the bulletin and how to get a message to congratulate him. And there was only one person they could go through for that information: Alfiers. Imaging the dragon lady besieged by his admirers filled Thaurbad with positive glee.""},{""text1"":""He was still in a good mood the next day when he took the ferry to his appointment with his healer, Telemichiel. The herbalist was new, a pretty Redguard woman who tried to talk to him, even after he gave her the note reading \""My name is Thaurbad Hulzik and I have an appointment with Telemichiel for eleven o'clock. Please forgive me for not talking, but I have no voicebox anymore.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Has it started raining yet?\"" she asked cheerfully. \""The diviner said it might.\""""},{""text1"":""Thaurbad frowned and shook his head angrily. Why was it that everyone thought that mute people liked to be talked to? Did soldiers who lost their arms like to be thrown balls? It was undoubtedly not a purposefully cruel behavior, but Thaurbad still suspected that some people just liked to prove that they weren't crippled too.""},{""text1"":""The examination itself was routine horror. Telemichiel performed the regular invasive torture, all the while chatting and chatting and chatting.""},{""text1"":""\""You ought to try talking once in a while.  That's the only way to see if you're getting better.  If you don't feel comfortable doing it in public, you could try practicing it by yourself,\"" said Telemichiel, knowing her patient would ignore her advice. \""Try singing in the bath. You'll probably find you don't sound as bad as you think.\""""},{""text1"":""Thaurbad left the examination with the promise of test results in a couple of weeks. On the ferry ride back home, Thaurbad began thinking of next week's temple bulletin. What about a double-border around the \""Last Sundas's Offering Plate\"" announcement? Putting the sermon in two columns instead of one might have interesting effects. It was almost unbearable to think that he couldn't get started on it until Alfiers sent him information.""},{""text1"":""When she did, it was with the note, \""LAST BULLETIN A LITTLE BETTER. NEXT TIME, DON'T USE THE WORD 'FORTUITOUS' IN PLACE OF 'FORTUNATE.' THE WORDS ARE NOT, IF YOU LOOK THEM UP, SYNONYMOUS.\""""},{""text1"":""In response, Thaurbad almost followed Telemichiel's advice by screaming obscenities at Gorgos. Instead, he drank a bottle of cheap wine, composed and sent a suitable reply, and fell asleep on the floor.""},{""text1"":""The next morning, after a long bath, Thaurbad began work on the Bulletin. His idea for putting a light shading effect on the \""Special Announcements\"" section had an amazing textural effect. Alfiers always hated the extra decorations he added to the borders, but using the Feyfolken quill, they looked strangely powerful and majestic.""},{""text1"":""Gorgos came to him with a message from Alfiers at that very moment as if in response to the thought. Thaurbad opened it up.  It simply said, \""I'M SORRY.\""""},{""text1"":""Thaurbad kept working. Alfiers's note he put from his mind, sure that she would soon follow it up with the complete message \""I'M SORRY THAT NO ONE EVER TAUGHT YOU TO KEEP RIGHT-HAND AND LEFT-HAND MARGINS THE SAME LENGTH\"" or \""I'M SORRY WE CAN'T GET SOMEONE OTHER THAN A WEIRD, OLD MAN AS SCRIBE OF OUR BULLETIN.\"" It didn't matter what she was sorry about. The columns from the sermon notes rose like the massive pillars of roses, crowned with unashamedly ornate headers. The obituaries and birth announcements were framed together with a spherical border, as a heartbreaking declaration of the circle of life. The Bulletin was simultaneously both warm and avant-garde. It was a masterpiece. When he sent it off to Alfiers late that afternoon, he knew she'd hate it, and was glad.""},{""text1"":""Thaurbad was surprised to get a message from the Temple on Loredas. Before he read the content, he could tell from the style that it wasn't from Alfiers. The handwriting wasn't Alfiers's usual belligerent slashing style, and it wasn't all in Alfiers's usual capital letters, which read like a scream from Oblivion.""},{""text1"":""\""Thaurbad, I thought you should know Alfiers isn't at the Temple anymore. She quit her position yesterday, very suddenly. My name is Vanderthil, and I was lucky enough (let me admit it now, I begged pitifully) to be your new Temple contact. I'm overwhelmed by your genius. I was having a crisis of faith until I read last week's Bulletin. This week's Bulletin is a miracle. Enough. I just wanted to say I'm honored to be working with you. -- Vanderthil.\""""},{""text1"":""The response on Sundas after the service even astonished Thaurbad. The archpriest attributed the massive increase in attendance and collection plate offerings entirely to the Bulletin. Thaurbad's salary was quadrupled. Gorgos brought over a hundred and twenty messages from his adoring public.""},{""text1"":""The following week, Thaurbad sat in front of his writing plank, a glass of fine Torvali mead at his side, staring at the blank scroll. He had no ideas. The Bulletin, his child, his second-wife, bored him. The third-rate sermons of the archbishop were absolute anathema, and the deaths and births of the Temple patrons struck him as entirely pointless. Blah blah, he thought as he scribbled on the page.""},{""text1"":""He knew he wrote the letters B-L-A-H B-L-A-H. The words that appeared on the scroll were, \""A necklace of pearl on a white neck.\""""},{""text1"":""He scrawled a jagged line across the page. It appeared in through that damned beautiful Feyfolken quill: \""Glory to Auri-El.\""""},{""text1"":""Thaurbad slammed the quill and poetry spilled forth in a stream of ink. He scratched over the page, blotting over everything, and the vanquished words sprung back up in different form, even more exquisite than before. Every daub and splatter caused the document to whirl like a kaleidoscope before falling together in gorgeous asymmetry. There was nothing he could do to ruin the Bulletin. Feyfolken had taken over. He was a reader, not an author.""},{""text1"":""Now,\"" asked the Great Sage. \""What was Feyfolken from your knowledge of the School of Conjuration?\""""},{""text1"":""\""What happened next?\"" cried Vonguldak.""},{""text1"":""\""First, tell me what Feyfolken was, and then I'll continue the story.\""""},{""text1"":""\""You said it was a daedra,\"" said Taksim. \""And it seems to have something to do with artistic expression.  Was Feyfolken a servitor of Azura?\""""},{""text1"":""\""But the scribe may have been imagining all this,\"" said Vonguldak. \""Perhaps Feyfolken is a servitor of Sheogorath, and he's gone mad.  Or the quill's writing makes everyone who views it, like all the congregation at the Temple of Auri-El, go mad.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Hermaeus Mora is the daedra of knowledge ... and Hircine is the daedra of the wild ... and the daedra of revenge is Boethiah,\"" pondered Taksim. And then he smiled, \""Feyfolken is a servitor of Clavicus Vile, isn't it?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Very good,\"" said the Great Sage. \""How did you know?\""""},{""text1"":""\""It's his style,\"" said Taksim. \""Assuming that he doesn't want the power of the quill now that he has it.  What happens next?\""""},{""text1"":""\""I'll tell you,\"" said the Great Sage, and continued the tale.""},{""text1"":""Feyfolken""},{""text1"":""Book Three""},{""text1"":""\nby\nWaughin Jarth""},{""text1"":""\nThaurbad had at last seen the power of the quill,\"" said the Great Sage, continuing his tale. \""Enchanted with the daedra Feyfolken, servitor of Clavicus Vile, it had brought him great wealth and fame as the scribe of the weekly Bulletin of the Temple of Auri-El.  But he realized that it was the artist, and he merely the witness to its magic.  He was furious and jealous.  With a cry, he snapped the quill in half.""},{""text1"":""He turned to finish his glass of mead.  When he turned around, the quill was intact.""},{""text1"":""He had no other quills but the one he had enchanted, so he dipped his finger in the inkwell and wrote a note to Gorgos in big sloppy letters.  When Gorgos returned with a new batch of congratulatory messages from the Temple, praising his latest Bulletin, he handed the note and the quill to the messenger boy.  The note read: \""Take the quill back to the Mages Guild and sell it.  Buy me another quill with no enchantments.\""""},{""text1"":""Gorgos didn't know what to make of the note, but he did as he was told.  He returned a few hours later.""},{""text1"":""\""They wouldn't give us any gold back for it,\"" said Gorgos. \""They said it wasn't enchanted.  I told 'em, I said 'What are you talking about, you enchanted it right here with that Feyfolken soul gem,' and they said, 'Well, there ain't a soul in it now.  Maybe you did something and it got loose.'\""""},{""text1"":""Gorgos paused to look at his master.  Thaurbad couldn't speak, of course, but he seemed even more than usually speechless.""},{""text1"":""\""Anyway, I threw the quill away and got you this new one, like you said.\""""},{""text1"":""Thaurbad studied the new quill.  It was white-feathered while his old quill had been dove gray. It felt good in his hand.  He sighed with relief and waved his messenger lad away.  He had a Bulletin to write, and this time, without any magic except for his own talent.""},{""text1"":""Within two days time, he was nearly back on schedule. It looked plain but it was entirely his. Thaurbad felt a strange reassurance when he ran his eyes over the page and noticed some slight errors. It had been a long time since the Bulletin contained any errors. In fact, Thaurbad reflected happily, there were probably other mistakes still in the document that he was not seeing.""},{""text1"":""He was finishing a final whirl of plain calligraphy on the borders when Gorgos arrived with some messages from the Temple. He looked through them all quickly, until one caught his eye.  The wax seal on the letter read \""Feyfolken.\""  With complete bafflement, he broke it open.""},{""text1"":""\""I think you should kill yourself,\"" it read in perfectly gorgeous script.""},{""text1"":""He dropped the letter to the floor, seeing sudden movement on the Bulletin.  Feyfolken script leapt from the letter and coursed over the scroll in a flood, translating his shabby document into a work of sublime beauty. Thaurbad no longer cared about the weird croaking quality of his voice. He screamed for a very long time. And then drank. Heavily.""},{""text1"":""Gorgos brought Thaurbad a message from Vanderthil, the secretary of the Temple, early Fredas morning, but it took the scribe until mid-morning to work up the courage to look at it. \""Good Morning, I am just checking in on the Bulletin. You usually have it in on Turdas night. I'm curious. You planning something special? -- Vanderthil.\""""},{""text1"":""Thaurbad responded, \""Vanderthil, I'm sorry. I've been sick. There won't be a Bulletin this Sunday\"" and handed the note to Gorgos before retiring to his bath.  When he came back an hour later, Gorgos was just returning from the Temple, smiling.""},{""text1"":""\""Vanderthil and the archpriest went crazy,\"" he said. \""They said it was your best work ever.\""""},{""text1"":""Thaurbad looked at Gorgos, uncomprehending.  Then he noticed that the Bulletin was gone.  Shaking, he dipped his finger in the inkwell and scrawled the words \""What did the note I sent with you say?\""""},{""text1"":""\""You don't remember?\"" asked Gorgos, holding back a smile.  He knew the master had been drinking a lot lately.  \""I don't remember the exact words, but it was something like, 'Vanderthil, here it is. Sorry it's late. I've been having severe mental problems lately. - Thaurbad.'  Since you said, 'here it is,' I figured you wanted me to bring the Bulletin along, so I did.  And like I said, they loved it.  I bet you get three times as much letters this Sundas.\""""},{""text1"":""Thaurbad nodded his head, smiled, and waved the messenger lad away.  Gorgos returned back to the Temple, while his master turned to his writing plank, and pulled out a fresh sheet of parchment.""},{""text1"":""He wrote with the quill: \""What do you want, Feyfolken?\""""},{""text1"":""The words became: \""Goodbye. I hate my life. I have cut my wrists.\""""},{""text1"":""Thaurbad tried another tact: \""Have I gone insane?\""""},{""text1"":""The words became: \""Goodbye. I have poison. I hate my life.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Why are you doing this to me?\""""},{""text1"":""\""I Thaurbad Hulzik cannot live with myself and my ingratitude. That's why I've put this noose around my neck.\""""},{""text1"":""Thaurbad picked up a fresh parchment, dipped his finger in the inkwell, and proceeded to rewrite the entire Bulletin. While his original draft, before Feyfolken had altered it, had been simple and flawed, the new copy was a scrawl. Lower-case I's were undotted, G's looked like Y's, sentences ran into margins and curled up and all over like serpents. Ink from the first page leaked onto the second page. When he yanked the pages from the notebook, a long tear nearly divided the third page in half. Something about the final result was evocative. Thaurbad at least hoped so. He wrote another note reading, simply, \""Use this Bulletin instead of the piece of trash I sent you.\""""},{""text1"":""When Gorgos returned with new messages, Thaurbad handed the envelope to him.  The new letters were all the same, except for one from his healer, Telemichiel. \""Thaurbad, we need you to come in as soon as possible. We've received the reports from Black Marsh about a strain of the Crimson Plague that sounds very much like your disease, and we need to re-examine you. Nothing is definite yet, but we're going to want to see what our options are.\""""},{""text1"":""It took Thaurbad the rest of the day and fifteen drams of the stoutest mead to recover. The larger part of the next morning was spent recovering from this means of recovery. He started to write a message to Vanderthil: \""What did you think of the new Bulletin?\"" with the quill.  Feyfolken's improved version was \""I'm going to ignite myself on fire, because I'm a dying no-talent.\""""},{""text1"":""Thaurbad rewrote the note using his finger-and-ink message.  When Gorgos appeared, he handed him the note.  There was one message in Vanderthil's handwriting.""},{""text1"":""It read, \""Thaurbad, not only are you divinely inspired, but you have a great sense of humor.  Imagine us using those scribbles you sent instead of the real Bulletin.  You made the archbishop laugh heartily.  I cannot wait to see what you have next week.  Yours fondly, Vanderthil.\""""},{""text1"":""The funeral service a week later brought out far more friends and admirers than Thaurbad Hulzik would've believed possible. The coffin, of course, had to be closed, but that didn't stop the mourners from filing into lines to touch its smooth oak surface, imagining it as the flesh of the artist himself. The archbishop managed to rise to the occasion and deliver a better than usual eulogy. Thaurbad's old nemesis, the secretary before Vanderthil, Alfiers came in from Cloudrest, wailing and telling all who would listen that Thaurbad's suggestions had changed the direction of her life. When she heard Thaurbad had left her his quill in his final testament, she broke down in tears. Vanderthil was even more inconsolable, until she found a handsome and delightfully single young man.""},{""text1"":""\""I can hardly believe he's gone and I never even saw him face-to-face or spoke to him,\"" she said. \""I saw the body, but even if he hadn't been all burned up, I wouldn't have been able to tell if it was him or not.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I wish I could tell you there'd been a mistake, but there was plenty of medical evidence,\"" said Telemichiel. \""I supplied some of it myself. He was a patient of mine, you see.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Oh,\"" said Vanderthil. \""Was he sick or something?\""""},{""text1"":""\""He had the Crimson Plague years ago, that's what took away his voice box, but it appeared to have gone into complete remission. Actually, I had just sent him a note telling him words to that effect the day before he killed himself.\""""},{""text1"":""\""You're that healer?\"" exclaimed Vanderthil. \""Thaurbad's messenger boy Gorgos told me that he had just picked up that message when I sent mine, complementing him on the new, primative design for the Bulletin. It was amazing work. I never would've told him this, but I had begun to suspect he was stuck in an outmoded style. It turned out he had one last work of genius, before going out in a blaze of glory. Figuratively. And literally.\""""},{""text1"":""Vanderthil showed the healer Thaurbad's last Bulletin, and Telemichiel agreed that its frantic, nearly illegible style spoke volumes about the power and majesty of the god Auri-El.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Now I'm thoroughly confused,\"" said Vonguldak.""},{""text1"":""\""About which part?\"" asked the Great Sage. \""I think the tale is very straight-forward.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Feyfolken made all the Bulletins beautiful, except for the last one, the one Thaubad did for himself,\"" said Taksim thoughtfully. \""But why did he misread the notes from Vanderthil and the healer?  Did Feyfolken change those words?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Perhaps,\"" smiled the Great Sage.""},{""text1"":""\""Or did Feyfolken changed Thaurbad's perceptions of those words?\"" asked Vonguldak. \""Did Feyfolken make him mad after all?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Very likely,\"" said the Great Sage.""},{""text1"":""\""But that would mean that Feyfolken was a servitor of Sheogorath,\"" said Vonguldak. \""And you said he was a servitor of Clavicus Vile.  Which was he, an agent of mischief or an agent of insanity?\""""},{""text1"":""\""The will was surely altered by Feyfolken,\"" said Taksim, \""And that's the sort of thing a servitor of Clavicus Vile would do to perpetuate the curse.\""""},{""text1"":""\""As an appropriate ending to the tale of the scribe and his cursed quill,\"" smiled the Great Sage. \""I will let you read into it as you will.\""""}]"

The baby in the girl's arms woke and began to scream. The Song swelled in intensity, yet still remained subtle and stately in tempo.

Everything that came thereafter Tay had seen so many times, it had almost ceased to be a nightmare.""},{""text"":""He did not remember anything of his life before coming to the island of Gorne, but he understood that there was something different in his past that set him apart from his cousins.

At first the servants would dine in silence, attempting gentility, but they broke down and would regale the children with gossip, reports, stories, and rumors.""},{""text"":""\""Poor Arnyle is laid up with a fever again.\""""},{""text"":""\""I'm telling you, they're cursed.

She wasn't pretty like the other maids, but the scars on her face did not deform her. Her poorly set broken nose and her short hair gave her a certain alien mystique. She would merely quietly smile at the gossip, and look at Tay with almost frightening love and devotion.""},{""text"":""One day, after breakfast, Baynarah whispered to Tay and Vaster, \""We have to go to the hills on the other side of the island.\""""},{""text"":""She had used such imperatives before and always had something wonderful to show: a waterfall, tucked away behind ferns and tall rocks; a sunny grove of figs; a discreet still some peasants had set up; a sickly oak, twisted into a kneeling human figure; a collapsed stone wall that they imagined was thousands of years old, the last refuge of a doomed princess they named Merella.""},{""text"":""The three walked across through the forest until they came to a clearing. A few hundred feet beyond, the meadow sank to a dry creek bed, filled with small, smooth stones. They followed that into the dark woods where trees canopied high over their heads. Sporadic red and yellow blossoms burst along the moist underbrush, but they became rarer and rarer as the children marched on under the umbrageous oaks and elms. The air crackled with birds ticking a staccato choral piece, a minor chord of the Song.""},{""text"":""“Where are we going?” asked Tay.""},{""text"":""“It's not where we're going, it's what we're going to see,” replied Baynarah.""},{""text"":""The forest surrounded the three children completely, bathed them in its tenebrous hues, and breathed on them with wet chirrups and sighs. It was easy for them to imagine that they were within a monster, walking along its twisted spine of stones.""},{""text"":""Baynarah scrambled up the steep hill and peered through the thick mass of shrub and tree. Tay lifted Vaster out of the creek bed and climbed out, gripping soft grass for support. There was no path through the forest here. Brambles and low hanging branches struck at them like the claws of chained beasts. The cries of the birds became ever more stentorious, as if angered at the invasion. One limb drew blood on Vaster's cheek, but he didn't cry out. Even Baynarah, who could pass like an ethereal creature through impenetrable forests, had a braid catch on a bramble, ruining the intricate pattern a servant had woven hours before. She paused to pull out the other braid, so her bright unruly tresses fell freely behind her. Now she was something wild, a nymph guiding the other two through her woodland domain. The Song began to beat like a wild pulse.""},{""text"":""They were on a shelf of stone below a cliff overlooking a tremendous gorge, staring over an expanse of cinder. It looked like the scene of a tremendous battle, a holocaust of fire. Charred boxes, weaponry, animal bones, and detritus too annihilated to be identifiable littered the ground. Speechless, Tay and Vaster stepped into the black field. Baynarah smiled, proud that she had finally found something of true wonder and mystery.""},{""text"":""“What is this place?” asked Vaster at last.""},{""text"":""“I don't know,” Baynarah shrugged. “I thought at first that it was some kind of ruin, but now I think it's a junk pile, just not like any junk pile I've ever seen. Just look at this stuff.”""},{""text"":""The three began an unorganized survey of the dusty mounds of refuse. Baynarah found a twisted sword only lightly blackened by flame and began polishing it to read the inscriptions on the blade. Vaster amused himself by breaking brittle boxes with his hands and feet, imagining himself a giant of unbelievable strength. A battered shield attracted Tay: there was something about it that reverberated with the sound of the Song. He pulled it out, and wiped its surface clean.""},{""text"":""“I've never seen that crest before,” said Baynarah, looking over Tay's shoulder.""},{""text"":""“I think I have, but I don't remember,” Tay whispered, trying to conjure the memory from his dreams. He was sure he had seen it there.""},{""text"":""“Look at this!” Vaster cried, interrupting Tay's thoughts. The boy was holding up a crystal orb. As his hand moved over the surface, brushing away grit and dust, a key in the Song rose which sent a shiver through Tay's entire body. Baynarah ran over to look at Vaster's treasure, but Tay felt paralyzed.""},{""text"":""“Where did you find that?” she gasped, gazing into the swirl beneath the crystal surface.""},{""text"":""“Over in that wagon,” Vaster gestured toward a heap of blackened wood, barely discernible from the other piles but for its cart spokes. Baynarah began digging into the half-collapsed structure, so only her feet could be seen. The Song built in potency, sweeping over Tay. He began walking toward Vaster slowly.""},{""text"":""“Give me that,” he whispered in a voice he could barely recognize as his own.""},{""text"":""“No,” Vaster whispered back, his eyes locked on the colors reflected in the heart of the globe. “It's mine.”""},{""text"":""Baynarah dug through the remains of the wagon for several more minutes, but she could find no treasures like Vaster's. Most everything within was destroyed, and what remained was common-place by any standards: broken arrows, armor shards, guar bones. Frustrated, she pulled herself out into the sunlight.""},{""text"":""Tay was alone, at the edge of the great gorge.""},{""text"":""“Where's Vaster?”""},{""text"":""Tay blinked and then turned back to his cousin with a shrug and a grin: “He went back to show everyone his new plunder. Did you find anything interesting?”""},{""text"":""“Not really,” said Baynarah. “We probably ought to get back home before Vaster tells them anything that'll get us in trouble.”""},{""text"":""Tay and Baynarah started the walk back at a quick pace. Tay knew that Vaster would not be there when they got back. He would never be returning home again. The crystal globe rested snugly in Tay's satchel, hidden under a pile of junk he had picked up. With all his heart, he prayed for the Song to return and drown out the memory of the gorge and the long, silent fall down. The boy had been so surprised, he hadn't even time to scream.""},{""text"":""The Poison Song, Book II""},{""text"":""Tay felt no guilt, which frightened him. All through the long, fast walk away from the gorge, through the woods, across the dry creek bed, he chatted merrily with Baynarah, fully aware that he had just committed murder. Whenever his mind strayed from the conversation, and he thought back on the last moments of Vaster's short life, the Song would soar. He could not think of the boy's death, but Tay knew he was responsible.""},{""text"":""“You're a mess!” cried Aunt Ulliah the moment she saw the two children emerging from the woods onto the grounds of Sandil House. “Where have you been?”""},{""text"":""“Didn't Vaster already tell you?” asked Tay.""},{""text"":""The scene played itself out as Tay knew it would, every dancer in the Song performing their steps as choreographed. Aunt Ulliah saying that she had not seen Vaster. Baynarah, not yet frightened, making up an innocent lie about the threesome not having strayed far, saying he must have gotten lost. A slow but steady rhythm of panic intensifying as night began to fall, and Vaster had not yet returned. Baynarah and Tay tearfully (he was surprised how easy it was for him to cry without feeling) admitting where they had been, and leading Uncle Triffith and a crowd of servants to the junk pile and gorge. The tireless search through the woods as night turned to dawn. The weeping. The light punishment, merely cries of anger, that Baynarah and Tay suffered for losing their young cousin.""},{""text"":""It was thought, from their stricken expressions, that the children felt guilty enough. They were sent to bed at dawn while the hunt through the woods continued.""},{""text"":""Tay was drifting to sleep when his nursemaid Edebah came into his room. The look of unwavering love and devotion had not left her eyes, and he sank gratefully into his dreams and nightmares with her holding his hand. The Song wafted almost imperceptibly through his consciousness as he again had the vision of the room in the castle. The girl and her baby. The bird in the rafters. The dying fire. The sudden explosion of violence. Breathless, Tay opened his eyes.""},{""text"":""Edebah was stealing out the door, softly humming the Song to herself. In her hand was the crystal globe from his satchel. For a moment, he hesitated, about to cry out. How did she know the Song? Was she aware that he had murdered another boy to get the globe?""},{""text"":""Somehow he knew that she was helping him, that she knew all and loved him and sought only to protect him.""},{""text"":""The next day, and the next week, and the next month were all the same. No one spoke very much, and when they did it was to suggest new places to look for the missing boy. Everywhere had been searched thoroughly. Tay was curious why they never looked in the gorge, but he understood how inaccessible it was.""},{""text"":""A side-effect of Vaster's absence was that the tutorial sessions with Kena Gafrisi took on a more serious, even academic quality. The younger boy's high spirits and meager attentiveness had always cut the lessons short, but sensible Baynarah and quiet Tay were ideal pupils. He was particularly impressed by how focused they became during a rather dry history lecture about the heraldic symbols of Houses of Morrowind.""},{""text"":""“The crest of the Hlaalu features a scale,” he sniffed disdainfully. “They see themselves as the great compromisers, as if that were something honorable.

Our enemies together with the accursed heretical Dwemer in the War of the Red Mountain, now totally destroyed, thanks be to Lord, Mother, and Wizard. That House was a curse on our land for millennia, and when at last their pestilence was snuffed out, the very earth itself breathed a cloud of fire and ash in relief, bringing night to day for over a year's time.”""},{""text"":""Baynarah and Tay knew they could not speak, but they exchanged knowing glances at one another as the tutor enlarged on the theme of the great wickedness of the Dwemer and the House Dagoth. As soon as the lesson ended, they walked silently out of Sandil House until they were far from all ears and eyes.""},{""text"":""The afternoon sun stretched out the shadows of the spear-like trees surrounding the meadow. Off in the distance, they could hear the sounds of the workers beginning their preparations for the autumntide harvest, yelling to one another unintelligibly in coarse and familiar accents.""},{""text"":""“That was definitely the symbol on that shield you found at the garbage heap,” Baynarah said at last. “Everything there must be a remnant of the House Dagoth.”""},{""text"":""Tay nodded. His mind was on the strange crystal globe. He felt a light vibration of soundless music touch his body, and knew he was discovering a new cadence of the Song.""},{""text"":""“Why would our people have burned and discarded all that?” he asked thoughtfully. “Do you think the House Dagoth was so evil that everything associated with them could have been cursed?”""},{""text"":""Baynarah laughed. At the height of day, all talk of curses and the evil Sixth House were pure supposition: something to add romance to one's life, but nothing to worry about. The two children walked back to the castle for yet another in a series of cold, quiet dinners. As the night fell, Baynarah looked through the treasures she had picked up in the junk heap. By the light of the moons, the small jars, the torc with orange gemstones, the bits of tarnished silver and gold of no obvious purpose, all took on a sinister aspect.""},{""text"":""Revulsion overtook her feeling of admiration instantly. There was a strange energy to them, a tincture of death and corruption that was undeniable. Baynarah ran to the window and vomited.""},{""text"":""Looking out to the dark open lawn below, she saw a figure below lighting an arrangement of candles in the shape of a large insect, the symbol of the House Dagoth. When it looked in her direction, she pulled back, but she saw the face illuminated by the tallows. It was Edebah, Tay's nursemaid.""},{""text"":""The next morning, Baynarah left the castle grounds early, bearing a large sack filled with her treasures. She carried them to the dumping ground and left them there. Then she returned, and told her Uncle Triffith what she had seen the night before, leaving out only what had made her sick in the first place.""},{""text"":""Edebah was banished from the isle of Gorne without discussion. She wept, begging to be allowed to say goodbye to Tay, but all believed that would be too dangerous. When Tay asked what had become of her, he was told she had to return to her family on the mainland. He had grown too old for a nursemaid.""},{""text"":""Baynarah never told him what she knew. For she was afraid.""},{""text"":""The Poison Song, Book III""},{""text"":""Tay was eighteen in the year 685 of the First Era when he first saw Mournhold, the city of spires, home of the goddess. His cousin Kalkorith, already a senior initiate in the Temple, gave him a couple rooms on the ground floor of the house he had purchased. They were small and unfurnished, but bittergreen grew outside the windows, and when the wind blew, they filled his bedroom with a lovely spicy air.""},{""text"":""The chords of the Song did not trouble him anymore. Sometimes he was even unconscious to it, so low and melodic it had become. Occasionally when he was passing through the streets on the way to the Temple for his instruction, someone would pass him and the Song would rise in intensity before falling away again. Whatever was different about those people, Tay never tried to ascertain. He remembered the last time he had let the Song lead him, and called for him to murder his young cousin Vaster. The memory did not trouble him unduly, but he did not want to hurt anyone again unless he had to.""},{""text"":""House couriers regularly brought Tay letters from Baynarah, still back in Sandil House on the island of Gorne. She might have gone to study at the Temple, she was certainly intelligent enough, but she chose not to. In a year or two at most, she would have to leave and assume her place in House Indoril, but she was not in a hurry. Tay welcomed the trivial gossipy news the letters brought, and responded back with news of his own studies and romances.""},{""text"":""In his third month in Mournhold, he had already met a girl. She was also a student at the Temple, and her name was Acra. Tay wrote enthusiastically about her to Baynarah, describing her as having the mind of Sotha Sil, the wit of Vivec, and the beauty of Almalexia. Baynarah replied back merrily that if she had known how blasphemous students of the Temple were allowed to be, she might have become an initiate herself.""},{""text"":""“You are very devoted to your cousin,” Acra laughed when Tay showed her the letter. “Am I looking at the last remains of a thwarted romance?”""},{""text"":""“She's lovely, but I never thought of her that way,” Tay scoffed. “Incest never particularly interested me.”""},{""text"":""“Is she a very close cousin then?”""},{""text"":""Tay thought for a moment: “I don't know. Truthfully, no one spoke much of either her parents or mine, so I really don't know how we were connected. They were casualties of the War of the Red Mountain, that I know, and it seemed to cast rather a pall on the adults' humor whenever we asked about her parents or mine. After a while, we stopped asking. But you're an Indoril too. Perhaps you're a closer cousin to me than Baynarah.”""},{""text"":""“Perhaps so,” Acra smiled, rising from her chair. She uncoiled her hair, which had been pulled up in the formal arrangement reserved for well-born priestesses. As Tay watched transfigured, she removed the small brooch that fastened her robe to her shoulder cape. The soft silken fabric slipped down slowly, exposing her dark, slender body to him for the first time. “If we are, does incest particularly interest you now?”""},{""text"":""As they made love, the Song began a slow, rhythmic ascension in Tay's head. The vision of Acra before him darkened and was replaced by images from his nightmares before returning again. When finally he collapsed, spent, the room seemed filled with the fiery red clouds of his dream, and the scream of the woman and her child facing death echoed in his head. He opened his eyes, and there was Acra, smiling at him. Tay kissed her, grateful to have her in his arms.""},{""text"":""For the next two weeks, Tay and Acra were never far apart. Even when they were at study in opposite wings of the Temple, Tay thought of her, and somehow knew she was thinking of him. They would rush to be together afterwards, ravishing one another in his rooms every night, and in a private corner of the Temple garden every day.""},{""text"":""It was while Tay was rushing to see his beloved one afternoon that the Song rose up in powerful strident tones at the approach of an old, ragged woman. He closed his eyes and tried to quiet it, but when he looked again at her purchasing corkbulb papyrus from a street vendor, he knew who she was. His old nursemaid from Gorne, Edebah. She who had abandoned him without even a farewell to join her family on the mainland.""},{""text"":""She didn't see him, and as she passed down the street, Tay turned and began to follow. They walked through shadowy passageways into the very poorest part of the city, a quarter which was as alien to him as the wildest principality of Akavir. She unlocked a small wooden door on a street without a name, and he finally called out her name. She didn't turn, but when he followed, he found that the door had been left ajar.""},{""text"":""The chamber was murky and damp like a cave. She stood facing him, her face even more wrinkled than he had remembered it, etched with lines of sorrow. He closed the door behind him, and she took his hand and kissed it.""},{""text"":""“You are so tall and strong,” Edebah said, beginning to weep. “I should have killed myself before I let them take me away from you.”""},{""text"":""“How is your family?” Tay asked coldly.""},{""text"":""“You are my only family,” she whispered. “The Indoril pigs forced me to leave, thrusting their blades in my face, when they discovered that I serve you and your family, not them. That bitch girl Baynarah saw me at a prayer of mourning.”""},{""text"":""“You're speaking like a madwoman,” Tay sneered. “How could you love me and my family, but hate the House Indoril? I am of the House Indoril.”""},{""text"":""“You are old enough to know the truth,” Edebah said fiercely. Tay had bitterly joked about her madness, but he saw something close to it burning in her ancient eyes. “You were not born of House Indoril; they brought you into their house after the War, like they and the other Houses brought in all the orphans. It was the only way they saw to erase history and remove all traces of their enemies, by raising their enemies as one of them.”""},{""text"":""Tay turned toward the door: “I can see why you were taken away from Gorne, old woman. You are delusional.”""},{""text"":""“Wait!” Edebah cried, rushing to a musty cabinet. She retrieved from it a glass globe that shimmered with a spectrum of color even in the chamber's gloom. “Do you remember this? You slew that little boy Vaster because he possessed it, and I took it from your room because you were not ready to face the facts of your inheritance and responsibility then. Did you not wonder why this bauble drew you so?”""},{""text"":""Tay gasped, and though he did not want to, he said, “I hear a Song sometimes.”""},{""text"":""“That is the Song of your ancestors, of your true family,” she said, nodding. “You must not fight it, for it is a song of destiny. It will lead you to do what must be done.”""},{""text"":""“Shut up!” Tay howled, “Everything you say is a lie! You're insane!”""},{""text"":""Edebah threw the globe to the ground with all her might, shattering it with a deafening retort. The shards melted into the air. All that was left was a small silver ring, simply wrought with a flat crown.

He believes himself to be ... of the House Dagoth.”""},{""text"":""Ulliah took a moment to respond. “It's true. You were just a baby yourself during the War, so you couldn't know what it was like. There was not a part of Morrowind that wasn't ravaged. There was even a battle here on the island. Do you remember that burned pile of wreckage you and Tay and poor little Vaster discovered so many years ago? That was the remains. And after the War, when that accursed House was finally defeated, we saw the little innocents, the orphans whose only crime had been born to wicked parents. I admit there were some in our armies, the combined forces of the Houses, who would have had them all slaughtered to annihilate the legacy of Dagoth. In the end, compassion prevailed, and the children of the Sixth House were adopted into the other five.

Vaster.”""},{""text"":""Ulliah held her hands over her tearful face and could not speak.""},{""text"":""“And it is only beginning,” said Baynara. “The Song still calls to him.

Leryne, one of the chambermaids, had been decapitated while carrying some once-clean linens up the stairs. The bodies of guards and servants sprawled about the hall like blown leaves.

She wasn't pretty like the other maids, but the scars on her face did not deform her. Her poorly set broken nose and her short hair gave her a certain alien mystique. She would merely quietly smile at the gossip, and look at Tay with almost frightening love and devotion.""},{""text1"":""One day, after breakfast, Baynarah whispered to Tay and Vaster, \""We have to go to the hills on the other side of the island.\""""},{""text1"":""She had used such imperatives before and always had something wonderful to show: a waterfall, tucked away behind ferns and tall rocks; a sunny grove of figs; a discreet still some peasants had set up; a sickly oak, twisted into a kneeling human figure; a collapsed stone wall that they imagined was thousands of years old, the last refuge of a doomed princess they named Merella.""},{""text1"":""The three walked across through the forest until they came to a clearing. A few hundred feet beyond, the meadow sank to a dry creek bed, filled with small, smooth stones. They followed that into the dark woods where trees canopied high over their heads. Sporadic red and yellow blossoms burst along the moist underbrush, but they became rarer and rarer as the children marched on under the umbrageous oaks and elms. The air crackled with birds ticking a staccato choral piece, a minor chord of the Song.""},{""text1"":""“Where are we going?” asked Tay.""},{""text1"":""“It's not where we're going, it's what we're going to see,” replied Baynarah.""},{""text1"":""The forest surrounded the three children completely, bathed them in its tenebrous hues, and breathed on them with wet chirrups and sighs. It was easy for them to imagine that they were within a monster, walking along its twisted spine of stones.""},{""text1"":""Baynarah scrambled up the steep hill and peered through the thick mass of shrub and tree. Tay lifted Vaster out of the creek bed and climbed out, gripping soft grass for support. There was no path through the forest here. Brambles and low hanging branches struck at them like the claws of chained beasts. The cries of the birds became ever more stentorious, as if angered at the invasion. One limb drew blood on Vaster's cheek, but he didn't cry out. Even Baynarah, who could pass like an ethereal creature through impenetrable forests, had a braid catch on a bramble, ruining the intricate pattern a servant had woven hours before. She paused to pull out the other braid, so her bright unruly tresses fell freely behind her. Now she was something wild, a nymph guiding the other two through her woodland domain. The Song began to beat like a wild pulse.""},{""text1"":""They were on a shelf of stone below a cliff overlooking a tremendous gorge, staring over an expanse of cinder. It looked like the scene of a tremendous battle, a holocaust of fire. Charred boxes, weaponry, animal bones, and detritus too annihilated to be identifiable littered the ground. Speechless, Tay and Vaster stepped into the black field. Baynarah smiled, proud that she had finally found something of true wonder and mystery.""},{""text1"":""“What is this place?” asked Vaster at last.""},{""text1"":""“I don't know,” Baynarah shrugged. “I thought at first that it was some kind of ruin, but now I think it's a junk pile, just not like any junk pile I've ever seen. Just look at this stuff.”""},{""text1"":""The three began an unorganized survey of the dusty mounds of refuse. Baynarah found a twisted sword only lightly blackened by flame and began polishing it to read the inscriptions on the blade. Vaster amused himself by breaking brittle boxes with his hands and feet, imagining himself a giant of unbelievable strength. A battered shield attracted Tay: there was something about it that reverberated with the sound of the Song. He pulled it out, and wiped its surface clean.""},{""text1"":""“I've never seen that crest before,” said Baynarah, looking over Tay's shoulder.""},{""text1"":""“I think I have, but I don't remember,” Tay whispered, trying to conjure the memory from his dreams. He was sure he had seen it there.""},{""text1"":""“Look at this!” Vaster cried, interrupting Tay's thoughts. The boy was holding up a crystal orb. As his hand moved over the surface, brushing away grit and dust, a key in the Song rose which sent a shiver through Tay's entire body. Baynarah ran over to look at Vaster's treasure, but Tay felt paralyzed.""},{""text1"":""“Where did you find that?” she gasped, gazing into the swirl beneath the crystal surface.""},{""text1"":""“Over in that wagon,” Vaster gestured toward a heap of blackened wood, barely discernible from the other piles but for its cart spokes. Baynarah began digging into the half-collapsed structure, so only her feet could be seen. The Song built in potency, sweeping over Tay. He began walking toward Vaster slowly.""},{""text1"":""“Give me that,” he whispered in a voice he could barely recognize as his own.""},{""text1"":""“No,” Vaster whispered back, his eyes locked on the colors reflected in the heart of the globe. “It's mine.”""},{""text1"":""Baynarah dug through the remains of the wagon for several more minutes, but she could find no treasures like Vaster's. Most everything within was destroyed, and what remained was common-place by any standards: broken arrows, armor shards, guar bones. Frustrated, she pulled herself out into the sunlight.""},{""text1"":""Tay was alone, at the edge of the great gorge.""},{""text1"":""“Where's Vaster?”""},{""text1"":""Tay blinked and then turned back to his cousin with a shrug and a grin: “He went back to show everyone his new plunder. Did you find anything interesting?”""},{""text1"":""“Not really,” said Baynarah. “We probably ought to get back home before Vaster tells them anything that'll get us in trouble.”""},{""text1"":""Tay and Baynarah started the walk back at a quick pace. Tay knew that Vaster would not be there when they got back. He would never be returning home again. The crystal globe rested snugly in Tay's satchel, hidden under a pile of junk he had picked up. With all his heart, he prayed for the Song to return and drown out the memory of the gorge and the long, silent fall down. The boy had been so surprised, he hadn't even time to scream.""},{""text1"":""Tay felt no guilt, which frightened him. All through the long, fast walk away from the gorge, through the woods, across the dry creek bed, he chatted merrily with Baynarah, fully aware that he had just committed murder. Whenever his mind strayed from the conversation, and he thought back on the last moments of Vaster's short life, the Song would soar. He could not think of the boy's death, but Tay knew he was responsible.""},{""text1"":""“You're a mess!” cried Aunt Ulliah the moment she saw the two children emerging from the woods onto the grounds of Sandil House. “Where have you been?”""},{""text1"":""“Didn't Vaster already tell you?” asked Tay.""},{""text1"":""The scene played itself out as Tay knew it would, every dancer in the Song performing their steps as choreographed. Aunt Ulliah saying that she had not seen Vaster. Baynarah, not yet frightened, making up an innocent lie about the threesome not having strayed far, saying he must have gotten lost. A slow but steady rhythm of panic intensifying as night began to fall, and Vaster had not yet returned. Baynarah and Tay tearfully (he was surprised how easy it was for him to cry without feeling) admitting where they had been, and leading Uncle Triffith and a crowd of servants to the junk pile and gorge. The tireless search through the woods as night turned to dawn. The weeping. The light punishment, merely cries of anger, that Baynarah and Tay suffered for losing their young cousin.""},{""text1"":""It was thought, from their stricken expressions, that the children felt guilty enough. They were sent to bed at dawn while the hunt through the woods continued.""},{""text1"":""Tay was drifting to sleep when his nursemaid Edebah came into his room. The look of unwavering love and devotion had not left her eyes, and he sank gratefully into his dreams and nightmares with her holding his hand. The Song wafted almost imperceptibly through his consciousness as he again had the vision of the room in the castle. The girl and her baby. The bird in the rafters. The dying fire. The sudden explosion of violence. Breathless, Tay opened his eyes.""},{""text1"":""Edebah was stealing out the door, softly humming the Song to herself. In her hand was the crystal globe from his satchel. For a moment, he hesitated, about to cry out. How did she know the Song? Was she aware that he had murdered another boy to get the globe?""},{""text1"":""Somehow he knew that she was helping him, that she knew all and loved him and sought only to protect him.""},{""text1"":""The next day, and the next week, and the next month were all the same. No one spoke very much, and when they did it was to suggest new places to look for the missing boy. Everywhere had been searched thoroughly. Tay was curious why they never looked in the gorge, but he understood how inaccessible it was.""},{""text1"":""A side-effect of Vaster's absence was that the tutorial sessions with Kena Gafrisi took on a more serious, even academic quality. The younger boy's high spirits and meager attentiveness had always cut the lessons short, but sensible Baynarah and quiet Tay were ideal pupils. He was particularly impressed by how focused they became during a rather dry history lecture about the heraldic symbols of Houses of Morrowind.""},{""text1"":""“The crest of the Hlaalu features a scale,” he sniffed disdainfully. “They see themselves as the great compromisers, as if that were something honorable. Many hundreds of years ago, they were the tribesmen following Resdayn who chose--“""},{""text1"":""“Pardon me, Kena,” asked Baynarah. “But what is the crest with the insect on it?”""},{""text1"":""“You don't know House Redoran?” asked the tutor, lifting up one of the shields. “I know you have a sheltered life on Gorne, but you're surely old enough to recognize--\""""},{""text1"":""“Not that one, Kena,” replied Tay. “I think she means the other crest with an insect.”""},{""text1"":""“I see,” nodded Kena Gafrisi, brow furrowed. “Yes, you would be too young to have ever seen the crest of the Sixth House, the House of Dagoth. Our enemies together with the accursed heretical Dwemer in the War of the Red Mountain, now totally destroyed, thanks be to Lord, Mother, and Wizard. That House was a curse on our land for millennia, and when at last their pestilence was snuffed out, the very earth itself breathed a cloud of fire and ash in relief, bringing night to day for over a year's time.”""},{""text1"":""Baynarah and Tay knew they could not speak, but they exchanged knowing glances at one another as the tutor enlarged on the theme of the great wickedness of the Dwemer and the House Dagoth. As soon as the lesson ended, they walked silently out of Sandil House until they were far from all ears and eyes.""},{""text1"":""The afternoon sun stretched out the shadows of the spear-like trees surrounding the meadow. Off in the distance, they could hear the sounds of the workers beginning their preparations for the autumntide harvest, yelling to one another unintelligibly in coarse and familiar accents.""},{""text1"":""“That was definitely the symbol on that shield you found at the garbage heap,” Baynarah said at last. “Everything there must be a remnant of the House Dagoth.”""},{""text1"":""Tay nodded. His mind was on the strange crystal globe. He felt a light vibration of soundless music touch his body, and knew he was discovering a new cadence of the Song.""},{""text1"":""“Why would our people have burned and discarded all that?” he asked thoughtfully. “Do you think the House Dagoth was so evil that everything associated with them could have been cursed?”""},{""text1"":""Baynarah laughed. At the height of day, all talk of curses and the evil Sixth House were pure supposition: something to add romance to one's life, but nothing to worry about. The two children walked back to the castle for yet another in a series of cold, quiet dinners. As the night fell, Baynarah looked through the treasures she had picked up in the junk heap. By the light of the moons, the small jars, the torc with orange gemstones, the bits of tarnished silver and gold of no obvious purpose, all took on a sinister aspect.""},{""text1"":""Revulsion overtook her feeling of admiration instantly. There was a strange energy to them, a tincture of death and corruption that was undeniable. Baynarah ran to the window and vomited.""},{""text1"":""Looking out to the dark open lawn below, she saw a figure below lighting an arrangement of candles in the shape of a large insect, the symbol of the House Dagoth. When it looked in her direction, she pulled back, but she saw the face illuminated by the tallows. It was Edebah, Tay's nursemaid.""},{""text1"":""The next morning, Baynarah left the castle grounds early, bearing a large sack filled with her treasures. She carried them to the dumping ground and left them there. Then she returned, and told her Uncle Triffith what she had seen the night before, leaving out only what had made her sick in the first place.""},{""text1"":""Edebah was banished from the isle of Gorne without discussion. She wept, begging to be allowed to say goodbye to Tay, but all believed that would be too dangerous. When Tay asked what had become of her, he was told she had to return to her family on the mainland. He had grown too old for a nursemaid.""},{""text1"":""Baynarah never told him what she knew. For she was afraid.""},{""text1"":""Tay was eighteen in the year 685 of the First Era when he first saw Mournhold, the city of spires, home of the goddess. His cousin Kalkorith, already a senior initiate in the Temple, gave him a couple rooms on the ground floor of the house he had purchased. They were small and unfurnished, but bittergreen grew outside the windows, and when the wind blew, they filled his bedroom with a lovely spicy air.""},{""text1"":""The chords of the Song did not trouble him anymore. Sometimes he was even unconscious to it, so low and melodic it had become. Occasionally when he was passing through the streets on the way to the Temple for his instruction, someone would pass him and the Song would rise in intensity before falling away again. Whatever was different about those people, Tay never tried to ascertain. He remembered the last time he had let the Song lead him, and called for him to murder his young cousin Vaster. The memory did not trouble him unduly, but he did not want to hurt anyone again unless he had to.""},{""text1"":""House couriers regularly brought Tay letters from Baynarah, still back in Sandil House on the island of Gorne. She might have gone to study at the Temple, she was certainly intelligent enough, but she chose not to. In a year or two at most, she would have to leave and assume her place in House Indoril, but she was not in a hurry. Tay welcomed the trivial gossipy news the letters brought, and responded back with news of his own studies and romances.""},{""text1"":""In his third month in Mournhold, he had already met a girl. She was also a student at the Temple, and her name was Acra. Tay wrote enthusiastically about her to Baynarah, describing her as having the mind of Sotha Sil, the wit of Vivec, and the beauty of Almalexia. Baynarah replied back merrily that if she had known how blasphemous students of the Temple were allowed to be, she might have become an initiate herself.""},{""text1"":""“You are very devoted to your cousin,” Acra laughed when Tay showed her the letter. “Am I looking at the last remains of a thwarted romance?”""},{""text1"":""“She's lovely, but I never thought of her that way,” Tay scoffed. “Incest never particularly interested me.”""},{""text1"":""“Is she a very close cousin then?”""},{""text1"":""Tay thought for a moment: “I don't know. Truthfully, no one spoke much of either her parents or mine, so I really don't know how we were connected. They were casualties of the War of the Red Mountain, that I know, and it seemed to cast rather a pall on the adults' humor whenever we asked about her parents or mine. After a while, we stopped asking. But you're an Indoril too. Perhaps you're a closer cousin to me than Baynarah.”""},{""text1"":""“Perhaps so,” Acra smiled, rising from her chair. She uncoiled her hair, which had been pulled up in the formal arrangement reserved for well-born priestesses. As Tay watched transfigured, she removed the small brooch that fastened her robe to her shoulder cape. The soft silken fabric slipped down slowly, exposing her dark, slender body to him for the first time. “If we are, does incest particularly interest you now?”""},{""text1"":""As they made love, the Song began a slow, rhythmic ascension in Tay's head. The vision of Acra before him darkened and was replaced by images from his nightmares before returning again. When finally he collapsed, spent, the room seemed filled with the fiery red clouds of his dream, and the scream of the woman and her child facing death echoed in his head. He opened his eyes, and there was Acra, smiling at him. Tay kissed her, grateful to have her in his arms.""},{""text1"":""For the next two weeks, Tay and Acra were never far apart. Even when they were at study in opposite wings of the Temple, Tay thought of her, and somehow knew she was thinking of him. They would rush to be together afterwards, ravishing one another in his rooms every night, and in a private corner of the Temple garden every day.""},{""text1"":""It was while Tay was rushing to see his beloved one afternoon that the Song rose up in powerful strident tones at the approach of an old, ragged woman. He closed his eyes and tried to quiet it, but when he looked again at her purchasing corkbulb papyrus from a street vendor, he knew who she was. His old nursemaid from Gorne, Edebah. She who had abandoned him without even a farewell to join her family on the mainland.""},{""text1"":""She didn't see him, and as she passed down the street, Tay turned and began to follow. They walked through shadowy passageways into the very poorest part of the city, a quarter which was as alien to him as the wildest principality of Akavir. She unlocked a small wooden door on a street without a name, and he finally called out her name. She didn't turn, but when he followed, he found that the door had been left ajar.""},{""text1"":""The chamber was murky and damp like a cave. She stood facing him, her face even more wrinkled than he had remembered it, etched with lines of sorrow. He closed the door behind him, and she took his hand and kissed it.""},{""text1"":""“You are so tall and strong,” Edebah said, beginning to weep. “I should have killed myself before I let them take me away from you.”""},{""text1"":""“How is your family?” Tay asked coldly.""},{""text1"":""“You are my only family,” she whispered. “The Indoril pigs forced me to leave, thrusting their blades in my face, when they discovered that I serve you and your family, not them. That bitch girl Baynarah saw me at a prayer of mourning.”""},{""text1"":""“You're speaking like a madwoman,” Tay sneered. “How could you love me and my family, but hate the House Indoril? I am of the House Indoril.”""},{""text1"":""“You are old enough to know the truth,” Edebah said fiercely. Tay had bitterly joked about her madness, but he saw something close to it burning in her ancient eyes. “You were not born of House Indoril; they brought you into their house after the War, like they and the other Houses brought in all the orphans. It was the only way they saw to erase history and remove all traces of their enemies, by raising their enemies as one of them.”""},{""text1"":""Tay turned toward the door: “I can see why you were taken away from Gorne, old woman. You are delusional.”""},{""text1"":""“Wait!” Edebah cried, rushing to a musty cabinet. She retrieved from it a glass globe that shimmered with a spectrum of color even in the chamber's gloom. “Do you remember this? You slew that little boy Vaster because he possessed it, and I took it from your room because you were not ready to face the facts of your inheritance and responsibility then. Did you not wonder why this bauble drew you so?”""},{""text1"":""Tay gasped, and though he did not want to, he said, “I hear a Song sometimes.”""},{""text1"":""“That is the Song of your ancestors, of your true family,” she said, nodding. “You must not fight it, for it is a song of destiny. It will lead you to do what must be done.”""},{""text1"":""“Shut up!” Tay howled, “Everything you say is a lie! You're insane!”""},{""text1"":""Edebah threw the globe to the ground with all her might, shattering it with a deafening retort. The shards melted into the air. All that was left was a small silver ring, simply wrought with a flat crown. The old woman quietly picked it up and handed it to him, while he stood with his back against the door, trembling.""},{""text1"":""“This is your inheritance, as the bearer of the Sixth House.”""},{""text1"":""The ring's crown was meant for stamping and sealing official House proclamations. Tay had seen his uncle Triffith's similar ring, crested with the wing which was the seal of House Indoril. This ring was different, with an insect design which he remembered from the day when Kena Gafrisi had taught the House heraldry to Baynarah and him.""},{""text1"":""It was the symbol of the accursed House Dagoth.""},{""text1"":""The Song took over all of Tay's senses. He heard its music, smelled its horror, tasted its sadness, felt its power, and the only thing he could see before him was the flames of its destruction. When he took the ring and placed it on his finger, his mind was not aware of what he was doing. Nor was Tay aware of anything but the Song when he removed his dagger from its sheath and thrust it into his old nursemaid's heart.""},{""text1"":""Tay did not even hear her final words, when Edebah fell bleeding to the ground, and groaned with a blood-streaked smile, “Thank you.”""},{""text1"":""When the veil of the Song lifted, Tay did not realize at first he was no longer dreaming. Before him had been flames, the very ones that destroyed the home of his birth, and flames were before him again. But they were flames from a fire he had struck outside the crumbling tenement that were already bursting through walls, consuming the body of his old nursemaid.""},{""text1"":""Tay fled through the streets as people began to call for the guards.""},{""text1"":""Acra sat by the hearth in Tay's room, reading her book by the fire. It concerned some minutiae of theosophy that she did not believe in, but nevertheless found morbidly compelling. When the door opened and she heard Tay enter, she finished the paragraph she was reading before looking up.""},{""text1"":""“I've been here for hours, darling. If I knew you were going to be so late, I would have brought more books,” she giggled. When she saw Tay's face and the state of his clothing, her manner lost all frivolity. “What happened to you? Are you all right?”""},{""text1"":""“I've been to see my old childhood nursemaid, Edebah,” he said in a strange voice. “It was a sudden change of plans. I hadn't realized she was in Mournhold.”""},{""text1"":""“I wish I had known where you were going,” she said, rising slowly from her chair. “I would have loved to have met her.”""},{""text1"":""“Well, it's too late now. I've killed her.”""},{""text1"":""Acra inhaled deeply, studying Tay's frozen face. She took his hand. “Perhaps you ought to tell me everything.”""},{""text1"":""Tay let his beloved lead him to the hearth, where he sat blinking at the fire. He looked down at the silver ring on his finger. “Before I killed her, she gave me this. It's the sealing ring of the House Dagoth. She told me I was the bearer of the inheritance, and the Song I hear all the time in my head, the one that called me to kill another boy when I was young, and then Edebah herself, is the Song of my ancestors.”""},{""text1"":""Tay fell silent. Acra knelt by his side, stroking his ringed hand. “Tell me more.”""},{""text1"":""“My tutor Kena Gafrisi taught us that the House Dagoth was a curse on Morrowind. He said that when they were all destroyed at the end of the War, the very earth itself breathed in relief,” Tay closed his eyes. “I can see the obliteration. I can even hear it in the Song. Edebah told me that the five Houses adopted the orphan children of Dagoth, raising them in their own traditions. I thought she was mad or a liar, but the real lie was all those years I thought my family was House Indoril.”""},{""text1"":""“What are you going to do?” Acra whispered.""},{""text1"":""“Well, Edebah told me to follow the Song to my destiny,” Tay laughed bitterly. “But the Song led me to kill her, so I don't know if she'd still give me that recommendation now. I know that I need to leave Mournhold. Before I knew what I was doing, I set a fire in her tenement. The guards were called. I just don't know where I'd go.”""},{""text1"":""“You have many friends to shield you if you prove yourself to be the new leader of the return of the Sixth House,” Acra kissed the ring. “I will help you find them.”""},{""text1"":""Tay stared at her. “Why would you help me?”""},{""text1"":""“When you thought I was your cousin of the House Indoril, you did not mind having me though it might well have been incestuous,” Acra replied, meeting his eyes. “I have heard the Song too. It is not as strong with me as it was with you, but I never chose to ignore it. It taught me more than the ridiculous Temple priests and priestesses ever could. I knew that my true name was Dagoth-Acra, and I knew that I had a brother.”""},{""text1"":""“No,” Tay said through gritted teeth. “You're lying.”""},{""text1"":""“You are Dagoth-Tython.”""},{""text1"":""Tay shoved Acra hard against the wall and ran from the room. As he fled through the hall, he heard the sound of Kalkorith's footfall on the stairs behind him, a percussive instrument in the Song that was rising in his heart and head""},{""text1"":""“Cousin,” the senior initiate was saying. “Have you heard about the fire--\""""},{""text1"":""Tay unsheathed his dagger and turned, burying it to the hilt in Kalkorith's throat. “Cousin,” he hissed. “I am not your cousin.”""},{""text1"":""The streets of Mournhold were lit by the red glow of the tenement fire, spreading through the tight alleyways by a steady and intense gust of wind. It was as if Dagoth-Ur himself was looming over the city, fanning the flames his heir had struck. A House guard, running toward the blaze, stopped at the sight of Tay, standing uncertainly, swaying, before the front door of Kalkorith's house, a bloodied blade in his hand.""},{""text1"":""“What you done, serjo?”""},{""text1"":""Tay ran for the forest, his cape whipping behind him by the force of the howling wind. The guard clambered after him, sword drawn. He had no need to investigate the house to see the murder. He knew.""},{""text1"":""For hours, Tay raced through the wilderness, the Song pushing him onward. The sound of his pursuer faded away. At last, the trees thinned, and he saw nothing before him but air and water. A cliff, a hundred foot long plunge into the Inner Sea.""},{""text1"":""The Song told him no. It pulled him north, sweetly promising a place to rest among friends. More than friends -- people who would worship him as the heir of Dagoth. As he slowly walked toward the edge of the cliff, the Song became more threatening, warning him not to seek to avoid his fate. There was no escape in death.""},{""text1"":""Tay spat a curse upon his House and threw himself head first over the cliff.""},{""text1"":""It was another glorious day on the island of Gorne, the first one in weeks that Baynarah could truly enjoy. Uncle Triffith had important company, Housemen from far away, and she had been required to attend every dinner, every meeting, every ceremony. As a child, she remembered, she had hoped for some attention. Now nothing was more blissful than time away from her duties.""},{""text1"":""There was only one thing she wanted to do that she had to do indoors, and that was writing a letter to her cousin. But that could wait until the evening, she told herself. After all, he had not written her in many days. It was the influence of that girl, Acra. Not that she seemed disagreeable, but Baynarah knew how one's first love can be all-consuming. At least, she had read about it.""},{""text1"":""As she walked idly through the wildflower meadow, Baynarah was so distracted with her thoughts that she did not hear her maid Hillima calling. She was quite startled when she turned to see the young servant running up.""},{""text1"":""“Serjo,” she said, breathlessly. “Please come! Someone has washed up on the shore! It's your cousin, Serjo Indoril-Tay!”""},{""text1"":""For two days, the House healers attended Tay in his bed, and Baynarah sat by his side, holding his hand. He was feverish, neither asleep nor awake, screaming at invisible phantoms. The healers complimented the young man's fortitude. Bodies had washed ashore on the island of Gorne several times, many during the War, but never once had they seen one that lived afterwards.""},{""text1"":""Aunt Ulliah came in several times to bring Baynarah food: “You must be careful, dear, or when he's all well, he'll have to attend you on your sickbed.”""},{""text1"":""Tay's fever broke, and at last he was able to open his eyes and see the young woman with whom he had spent seventeen years, all but the first year of his life.

You remember when Kena Grafisi taught us about the House Dagoth, and its corruption. That night, I saw your nursemaid making some kind of altar out on the north lawn, using the symbol of the Sixth House. She must have been doing it for years, but I never knew what it meant. I told Uncle Triffith, and he sent her away. I've wanted to tell you so many times now, but I was afraid to. She was so devoted to you.”""},{""text1"":""Tay smiled. “And didn't it frighten you even more to wonder if there was any connection between her devotion to me, and her devotion to the accursed House? I know you, Baynarah.

When we were young, I killed Vaster because the Song told me he had stolen my inheritance. When Edebah told me who I was and gave me this ring, I killed her and burned her house to the ground, because the Song told me she had served her purpose. When I returned to Kalkorith's house, my love was there, telling me that she was of the House Dagoth too, and my sister. I fled, and when Kalkorith tried to stop me, I slew him, because the Song told me he was an enemy.”""},{""text1"":""“Tay, stop,” Baynarah sobbed. “I don't believe a word of it.

And Vaster and Kalkorith? They were our cousins!”""},{""text1"":""“They were not my true cousins,” Tay said coldly. “The Song told me they were my foes. Just as it's telling me now that you're my foe, but I won't listen. And I'll keep from listening... as long as I can.”""},{""text1"":""Baynarah fled from the room, slamming the door behind her. She took a key from the her startled maid Hillima, and secured the lock.""},{""text1"":""“Serjo Indoril-Baynarah,” Hillima whispered, with great sympathy. “Is all well with your cousin, Serjo Indoril-Tay?”""},{""text1"":""“He'll be perfectly fine once he rests,” Baynarah recovered her dignity, wiping the tears from her face. “No one is to disturb him under any circumstances.

Tay's words never left her, but she found temporary comfort talking to the fishermen about their haul, helping determine how much should be smoked, how much should be sent to the village, how much should be delivered fresh to the House larder.""},{""text1"":""Her aunt Ulliah joined the discussion, oblivious to Baynarah's well-disguised agony. Together, they discussed how many provisions Uncle Triffith and his commanders had devoured during their weeks on the island, when they would be expected to return, and how best to prepare. One of the fishermen on the docks called out, interrupting.""},{""text1"":""“A boat is coming!”""},{""text1"":""Ulliah and Baynarah greeted the visitor as she arrived. It was a young woman dressed in the robes of a Temple priestess. As she docked her small boat, Baynarah marveled at how beautiful she was, and strangely familiar.""},{""text1"":""“Welcome to Gorne,” said Baynarah. “I am Indoril-Baynarah and this is my aunt Indoril-Ulliah. Have we met before?”""},{""text1"":""“I don't believe so, serjo,” the woman bowed. “I was sent by the Temple to inquire whether word had come from your cousin, Indoril-Tay. He has been missing from his classes for some days now, and the priests have become concerned.”""},{""text1"":""“Oh, we should have sent word,” Ulliah fretted. “He came here a few days ago, half-drowned. He's better now. Let us escort you up to the house.”""},{""text1"":""“Tay's resting now, and I asked that he not be disturbed,” Baynarah stammered. “Actually, I know it's dreadful manners, but I need to talk to my aunt for a moment. Would it be too terrible if I asked you to wait for us at the house? You have only to follow the path up the hill and across the lawn.”""},{""text1"":""The priestess bowed again humbly, and began the walk. Ulliah was scandalized.""},{""text1"":""“You know better than to treat a representative of the Temple that way,” she snapped. “You can't be so exhausted from tending your cousin to have lost all sense of civility.”""},{""text1"":""“Aunt Ulliah,” Baynarah whispered, drawing the woman away from the ears of the fishermen. “Is Tay truly my cousin? He believes himself to be ... of the House Dagoth.”""},{""text1"":""Ulliah took a moment to respond. “It's true. You were just a baby yourself during the War, so you couldn't know what it was like. There was not a part of Morrowind that wasn't ravaged. There was even a battle here on the island. Do you remember that burned pile of wreckage you and Tay and poor little Vaster discovered so many years ago? That was the remains. And after the War, when that accursed House was finally defeated, we saw the little innocents, the orphans whose only crime had been born to wicked parents. I admit there were some in our armies, the combined forces of the Houses, who would have had them all slaughtered to annihilate the legacy of Dagoth. In the end, compassion prevailed, and the children of the Sixth House were adopted into the other five. And so we thought that we had won the war and the peace.”""},{""text1"":""“By the Mother, Lord, and Wizard, if all that Tay believes is true, then there is no peace,” Baynarah trembled. “He claims that the Song of his ancestors called to him, and forced him to slay three people, two of them our Housemen. Cousin Kalkorith and ... when he was a little boy ... Vaster.”""},{""text1"":""Ulliah held her hands over her tearful face and could not speak.""},{""text1"":""“And it is only beginning,” said Baynara. “The Song still calls to him. He said there were others who knew, who would help him raise up the Sixth House. His sister...”""},{""text1"":""“It must be an evil fantasy,” Ulliah murmured. She noticed that Baynarah's gaze was now upon the path leading from the docks towards the house. “Niece, what are you thinking?”""},{""text1"":""“Did that priestess give us her name?”""},{""text1"":""The two women ran up the path, calling for guards. The fishermen, who had never seen the mistresses of the house so undone, looked briefly at one another and then followed quickly behind, pulling out their hooks and blades.""},{""text1"":""The front gate to Sandil House stood wide open, the first of the corpses lying close within. It was now an abattoir, painted fresh with blood. There was Aner, uncle Triffith's valet, gutted but still seated at the foyer table where he had been enjoying his afternoon glass of flin. Leryne, one of the chambermaids, had been decapitated while carrying some once-clean linens up the stairs. The bodies of guards and servants sprawled about the hall like blown leaves. At the top of the stairs, Baynarah had to hold back a sob when she saw Hillima. She lay like a broken doll, slain as she tried to pull herself out onto the narrow window ledge.""},{""text1"":""No one spoke, not Baynarah, nor Aunt Ulliah, nor the fishermen, as they walked slowly through the blood-drenched house. They passed Tay's sick-room, its door broken open, and no one within. When they heard the sound of footsteps in Baynarah's room down the hall, they approached slowly, cautiously, with great dread.""},{""text1"":""The priestess from the docks was standing by the bed. In her hand was the silver ring Baynarah had taken from Tay's finger. In her other hand was a long, curved blade, splashed like her once pristine gown, with gore.

She motioned for the fishermen, who advanced with their weaponry. “Tear her apart.”""},{""text1"":""“The Sixth House will rise again, and Dagoth-Tython will lead us!” Acra laughed. Her words were still echoing as she gave the sign of Recall and vanished like a ghost.""},{""text1"":""The magnificent sprawl of the stronghold of Indoranyon was aglow in the light of the setting sun. Commander Jasrat watched it slowly disappear into the horizon as he led the caravan southwestward. It was a strange practice for him to lead a night operation, but scarcely more bizarre than anything else he was facing. He was only seventy years of age, far from old for a Bosmer, and yet he felt like he belonged to another era.""},{""text1"":""He had known the land of east Vvardenfell his entire life. Every forest, every garden, every small village between Red Mountain and the Sea of Ghosts had been home to him.

It made night travel all the more treacherous, but it was a risk he was ordered to take.""},{""text1"":""The ashmire appeared quite suddenly. If a sharp-sighted scout hadn't seen it and given the signal, the entire caravan might have been swallowed whole. Jasrat cursed. It had not been on the map, but that was hardly surprising.""},{""text1"":""It was a huge unnamed scathe stretching as far as anyone could see. The commander considered his options. He might lead his party to the southeast toward Tel Aruhn and then try an approach due west. As he consulted his map, he noticed a glimmer of a campfire in the distance. Accompanied by his lieutenants, Jasrat drove his guar forward to investigate what appeared to be an Ashlander man and woman.""},{""text1"":""“This is no longer your realm,” he bellowed. “Don't you know it's been ruled by the Temple that these are House lands now?”""},{""text1"":""The couple shuffled to their feet, and began quietly walking away, toward a narrow ridge between hill and ashmire. Jasrat called them back.""},{""text1"":""“Do you know a way around the scathe?” he asked. They nodded, their eyes still to the ground. Jasrat signaled to his caravan. “You will lead us then.”""},{""text1"":""It was a treacherous winding crossing, almost too tight for the guars. The wagons themselves scraped as the drivers pulled to avoid the ashmire. The Ashlander man and woman whispered to one another as they led the caravan.""},{""text1"":""“What are you mumbling about, n'wah?” Jasrat hollered.""},{""text1"":""The man did not turn around. “My sister and I were talking about the Dagoth rebellion, and she was guessing that you were bringing arms to the stronghold at Falensarano, which is why you chose to cross the ashmire rather than taking a road.”""},{""text1"":""“I might have known,” Jasrat laughed. “You Ashlanders are so hopeful whenever you see signs of trouble in the Houses and the Temple. I hate to dampen your spirits, but what you're speaking of is hardly a rebellion. Merely a few isolated incidents of... unpleasantness. Tell your sister that.”""},{""text1"":""As they plodded onward, the narrow ridge began to taper even more. The Ashlanders found a low jagged crevasse in the hills, a crack from a lava flow even predating Sun's Death. The caravan scored the rock walls at it moved through. Commander Jasrat, after twenty years of uncertainty in a land he did not understand, felt a twinge of his old instinct. This, he thought to himself, would be a fine place for an ambush.""},{""text1"":""“Ashlander, how close are we?” he shouted.""},{""text1"":""“We've arrived,” Dagoth-Tython replied, and gave the signal.""},{""text1"":""The assault was over in mere minutes, as it had been calculated from the start. When the last body of the House guard had sunk beneath the ashmire, only then was the inventory of the caravan revealed. It was better than they had hoped, virtually everything the rebellion needed. Daedric swords, dozens of suits of armor, quivers of fine ebony bolts, and rations enough to last for weeks.""},{""text1"":""“Go on ahead to the camp,” Tython smiled at his sister. “I'll lead the caravan. We should be there within a few hours' time.”""},{""text1"":""Acra kissed him passionately, and gave the sign of Recall. In an instant, she was back in her tent, exactly as she had left it. Humming the Song, she removed the Ashlander rags and chose an appropriately diaphanous gown from her trunks.

Tython and the others will be here very soon with all the weapons and rations we need!”""},{""text1"":""“Muorasa can't hear you now,” said a voice Acra hadn't heard in weeks. She turned, expertly removed every trace of surprise from her face. It was indeed Indoril-Baynarah, but not the quivering creature she had left behind at the massacre at Sandil House. This woman was an armored warrior, who spoke with mocking confidence. “She wouldn't be able to summon the troops if she could. You may have weapons and rations, Acra, but there's no one left to arm or feed.”""},{""text1"":""Dagoth-Acra made the sign of Recall, but nothing happened.""},{""text1"":""“The moment we heard you banging around in the tent, my battlemages cast a diffusion of all magicka,” Baynara smiled, opening the tent further to invite a dozen House soldiers in. “You won't be leaving.”""},{""text1"":""“If you think that my brother will walk into your trap, you underestimate his allegiance to the Song,” Acra sneered. “It tells him everything he needs to know. I have convinced him to no longer fight it, and let it lead him and us to our ultimate victory.”""},{""text1"":""“I've known him longer and better than you ever did,” said Baynarah coldly. “Now, I want to hear what the Song is saying to you. I want to know where I can find Tay.”""},{""text1"":""“Tython, my lady,” Acra corrected her. “He is no longer a slave to your House and the Temple's lies.

It was all a part of warfare, she understood that, but there would be little relish in witnessing it. She could not even watch as the House soldiers disposed of the rebel corpses. She had hoped she would grow numb to the bloodshed after weeks of following Tython and Acra, massacre after massacre. It didn't matter to her that now the bodies were of her enemies. Death was still death.""},{""text1"":""She had only been in her tent for a few minutes when her nightblade appeared.""},{""text1"":""“Not so tough as she appeared, that one,” he grinned. “In point of fact, all I had to do is ask her nice and point my dagger at her belly, and she was blubbering everything.

General Indoril-Triffith.”""},{""text1"":""“Uncle Triffith,” Baynarah gasped. “Where is he stationed now?”""},{""text1"":""“I'm not sure myself, serjo. Do you want me to ask if she knows?”""},{""text1"":""“I'll come with you,” said Baynarah. As they walked towards Acra's tent, cries of alarm sounded.

Metaphors the poets used fell rather flat in his view. A festering wound it could be called with its blood-like lava. The King of Ash, too, could be applied, when one looked at its perpetual crown of smoke. And yet, none of that would do, for nothing in his experience could convey the sheer magnitude of the mountain. Red Mountain was many miles away from the fortress, and yet it filled the horizon utterly.""},{""text1"":""Before he could feel too small, however, he heard his name being called within. It was some consolation that though he was insignificant compared to the mountain, he was still in possession of certain power and influence.""},{""text1"":""“General Indoril-Triffith,” said Commander Rael. “There's trouble at the east gate.”""},{""text1"":""The trouble was scarcely more than a skirmish. An Ashlander, drunk perhaps on shein, had begun a fight with the House guards at the back gate. As they tried to drive him away, his cousins joined him, and soon there were six Ashlanders altogether brawling with a dozen of Triffith's guards. If the n'wahs had not been well-armed, the fight could have been finished almost before it began. As it was, by the time the General arrived with more of his guards, two of the Ashlanders were dead and the others had taken flight.""},{""text1"":""“It's the smoke in their brains,” Rael shrugged. “Makes them mad.”""},{""text1"":""Triffith climbed back up the stairs and returned to his chamber to dress for dinner. General Redoran-Vorilk and Counselor Hlaalu-Nothoc would be arriving very shortly to discuss the Temple's plans for reorganizing the House lands of Morrowind. Mournhold was to be renamed Almalexia. A great new city in honor of Vivec was to be built, but with whose gold? It made his head hurt. There were so many details, a long night of argument, threats, and compromises were ahead.""},{""text1"":""The General's mind was so occupied that he nearly put his House robes on backwards.

Very clever, Tay,” he said simply. “Or do you call yourself Dagoth-Tython these days?”""},{""text1"":""“You should know all my names,” the young man snarled, unsheathing his sword. “I was Tython before you butchered my family and sought to dispel my tribe. I was Tay when you brought me into your House to poison me against my own people. Now you may call me Vengeance.”""},{""text1"":""There was a knock on the door.

A familiar voice replaced the sound.""},{""text1"":""“Tay,” called Baynarah. “Listen to me.”""},{""text1"":""Tython smirked, “You're just in time to hear your uncle beg for his miserable life, 'cousin.' I was afraid you'd be too late. The next sound you'll hear will be the death rattle of the man who slaved my House.”""},{""text1"":""“The Song is what's enslaved you, not Uncle Triffith.

If you just listen to me, and not the Song just a moment, you'll know what's right. I love you.” Baynarah stifled her sobs to keep her voice clear and calm.

General Indoril-Triffith was holding his throat, staring out the window.""},{""text1"":""“Uncle! Are you all right?” Baynara ran to him. He nodded his head slowly, and removed his hand. There was only the barest of scratches on his neck. “Where's Tay?”""},{""text1"":""“He jumped out the window,” said Triffith, pointing out into the distance where a figure was riding a guar toward the volcano. “I thought he was going to kill himself, but he had an escape figured out.”""},{""text1"":""“We'll get him, serjo general,” said Commander Rael, calling to the guards to get their mounts.

Near-blind, it was almost impossible to ignore the persistent, clamorous notes of the Song.""},{""text1"":""A silken stream of crimson lava studded with crystalline formations surged a few feet away, close enough that Tay could feel his flesh begin to burn and blister.

The combination made him feel energized. Aerin had described the sensation perfectly, just as she had explained how to defend himself while wearing netch leather armor.""},{""text1"":""Under cover of night, Menegur crept out of the back gate of the castle, locking it behind him with a rather cumbersome key. He made for the arbor as quietly as he could, but a passing sentry, coming behind a tree, saw him. Remaining calm, Menegur did as he remembered Aerin had instructed, only moving after the attack had been launched. The sentry's blade glided against the armor and knocked to the left, throwing the young man off balance. That was the trick, as he understood it: you had to be prepared to be hit, and merely move with the blow, allowing the membranous armor to divert the injury away.""},{""text1"":""Use your enemy's momentum against him, as Aerin used to say.""},{""text1"":""There were several more close encounters in the arbor, but each swing of an ax and each thrust of a sword found purchase elsewhere.

In such a way, he lived and survived his lonely vigil in Cascabel Hall.""},{""text1"":""Four months later, as he was preparing for another seizure of apples, Menegur heard a loud clamor at the front gate. Surveying the group from a safe distance on the battlements, he saw the shields of the King of Solitude, his ally the Count of Cascabel, and their enemy the King of Farrun. Evidently, a truce had been called.""},{""text1"":""Menegur opened the gates and the combined armies flooded the courtyard. Many of the knights of Farrun sought to shake the hand of the man they had named the Shadow of the Arbor, expressing their admiration at his defensive skills and apologizing good-naturedly for their attempts to slay him. Only doing their job, you know.""},{""text1"":""\""There's hardly a apple left on the vines,\"" said the King of Solitude.""},{""text1"":""\""Well, I started on the edges and worked my way in,\"" explained Menegur. \""I brought back extra fruit to tempt the rats of out of walls so I could have a little meat as well.\""""},{""text1"":""\""We've spent the last several months working out the details of the truce,\"" said the King. \""Really quite exhausting. In any rate, the Count will be taking back possession of his castle now, but there is a small detail we need to work out. You're a mercenary, and as such responsible for your own expenses. If you had been a subject of mine, things might be different, but there are certain old rules of law that must be respected.\""""},{""text1"":""Menegur anticipated the strike.""},{""text1"":""\""The problem is,\"" the King continued. \""You've taken a good deal of the Count's crops while here. By any reasonable computation, you've eaten an amount equal to and likely exceeding your mercenary's wages. Obviously, I would not want to penalize you for the excellent job you've done defending the castle in uncomfortable circumstances, but you agree that it's important that we observe the old rules of law, don't you?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Of course,\"" replied Menegur, accepting the blow.""},{""text1"":""\""I'm delighted to hear that,\"" said the King. \""Our estimation is that you owe the Count of Cascabel thirty-seven Imperial gold.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Which I will gladly pay to myself, with interest, after the autumntide harvest,\"" said Menegur. \""There is more left on the vine than you suggest.\""""},{""text1"":""The Kings of Solitude and Farrun, and the Count of Cascabel stared at the Bosmer.""},{""text1"":""\""We agreed to abide to the strictest old rules of law, and I've had time to read a great many books over the time you were making your truce. In 3E 246, during the reign of Uriel IV, the Imperial Council, in an attempt to clear up some questions of property rights in Skyrim during those chaotic days, decreed that any man without a liege who occupied a castle for more than three months would be granted the rights and titles of that estate. It's a good law, of course, meant to discourage absent and foreign landlords.\"" Menegur smiled, feeling the now familiar sensation of a glancing strike diverting. \""By the rule of law, I am the Count of Cascabel.\""""},{""text1"":""The rear-guard's son still hold the title of Count of Cascabel.

The locals decided that she was young and pretty by her figure and her poise, though no one ever saw her face.  She and the armorer would retire to the back of his shop, and he would close down his business and dismiss his apprentices for a few hours.  Then, at mid-afternoon, she would leave, only to return at precisely the same time the next day. As gossip goes, it was fairly meager stuff, though what the old man was doing with such a well dressed and attractively proportioned woman was the source of several crude jokes.  After several weeks, the visits stopped, and life returned to normal in the slums of Tear.""},{""text1"":""It was not until a month or two after the visits had stopped, that in one of the many taverns in the neighborhood, a young local tailor, having imbibed too much sauce, asked the armorer, \""So whatever happened to your lady friend?  You break her heart?\""""},{""text1"":""The armorer, well aware of the rumors, simply replied, \""She is a proper young lady of quality.  There was nothing between her and the likes of me.\""""},{""text1"":""\""What was she doing at your shop every day for?\"" asked the tavern wench, who had been dying to get the subject open.""},{""text1"":""\""If you must know,\"" said the armorer. \""I was teaching her the craft.\""""},{""text1"":""\""You're putting us on,\"" laughed the tailor.""},{""text1"":""\""No, the young lady had a particular fascination with my particular kind of artistry,\"" the armorer said, with a hint of pride before getting lost in the reverie. \""I taught her how to mend swords specifically, from all kinds of nicks and breaks, hairline fissures, cracked pommels, quillons, and grips.  When she first started, she had no idea how to secure the grips to the tang of the blade... Well, of course she was green to start off with, why wouldn't she be?  But she weren't afraid to get her hands dirty.  I taught her how to patch the little inlaid silver and gold filigree you find on really fine blades, and how to polish it all to a mirror sheen so the sword looks like the gods just pulled it from their celestial anvil.\""""},{""text1"":""The tavern wench and the tailor laughed out loud.  No matter what he alleged, the armorer was speaking of the young lady's training as another man speaks of a long lost love.""},{""text1"":""More of the locals in the tavern would have listened to the armorer's pathetic tale, but more important gossip had taken precedence.  There was another murdered slave-trader found in the center of town, gutted from fore to aft.  That made six of them total in barely a fortnight.  Some called the killer \""The Liberator,\"" but that sort of anti-slavery zeal was rare among the common folk.  They preferred calling him \""The Lopper,\"" as several of the earlier victims had been completely beheaded.  Others had been simply perforated, sliced, or gutted, but \""The Lopper\"" still kept his original sobriquet.""},{""text1"":""While the enthusiastic hooligans made bets about the condition of the next slave-trader's corpse, several dozen of the surviving members of that trade were meeting at the manor house of Serjo Dres Minegaur.  Minegaur was a minor houseman of House Dres, but a major member of the slave-trading fraternity.  Perhaps his best years were behind him, but his associates still counted on him for wisdom.""},{""text1"":""\""We need to take what we know of this Lopper and search accordingly,\"" said Minegaur, seated in front of his opulent hearth. \""We know he has an unreasonable hatred of slavery and slave-traders.  We know he is skilled with a blade. We know he has the stealth and finesse to execute our most well-secured brethren in their most secure abodes.  It sounds to me to be an adventurer, an Outlander.  Surely no citizen of Morrowind would strike at us like this.\""""},{""text1"":""The slave-traders nodded in agreement.  An Outlander seemed most likely for their troubles.  It was always true.""},{""text1"":""\""Were I fifty years younger, I would take down my blade Akrash from the hearth,\"" Minegaur made an expansive gesture to the shimmering weapon. \""And join you in seeking out this terror.  Search him out where adventurers meet -- taverns and guildhalls.  Then show him a little lopping of my own.\""""},{""text1"":""The slave-traders laughed politely.""},{""text1"":""\""You wouldn't let us borrow your blade for the execution, I suppose, would you, Serjo?\"" asked Soron Jeles, a young toadying slaver enthusiastically.""},{""text1"":""\""It would be an excellent use for Akrash,\"" sighed Minegaur. \""But I vowed to retire her when I retired.\""""},{""text1"":""Minegaur called for his daughter Peliah to bring the slavers more flin, but they waved the girl away.  It was to be a night for hunting the Lopper, not drinking away their troubles.

She knew Kazagh had been waiting for her for hours in the stables.""},{""text1"":""He sprung out at her from the shadows, and wrapping his strong, furry arms around her, kissed her long and sweet.

My nurse sometimes comes in to ask me some detail about the wedding, as if I had any choice in the matter at all.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I promise you,\"" said Kazagh very seriously. \""You will not be forced into any marriage to cement your family's slave-dealing dynasty.  The last scabbard Akrash will be sheathed into will be your father's heart.  And when you are an orphan, you can free the slaves, move to a more enlightened province, and marry who you like.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I wonder who that will be,\"" Peliah teased, and raced out of the stables.""},{""text1"":""Just before dawn, Peliah awoke and crept out to the garden, where she found Akrash hidden in the bittergreen vines.  The edge was still relatively keen, but there were scratches vertically across the blade's surface.  Another beheading, she thought, as she took pumice stone and patiently rubbed out the marks, finally polishing it with a solution of salt and vinegar.  It was up on the mantle in pristine condition when her father came into the sitting room for his breakfast.""},{""text1"":""When the news came that Kemillith Torom, Peliah's husband-to-be, had been found outside of a canton, his head on a spike some feet away, she did not have to pretend to grieve.  Her father knew she did not want to marry him.""},{""text1"":""\""It is a shame,\"" he said. \""The lad was a good slaver.  But there are plenty of other young men who would appreciate an alliance with our family.  What about young Soron Jeles?\""""},{""text1"":""Two days nights later, Soron Jeles was visited by the Lopper.  The struggle did not take long, but Soron had had armed himself with one small defense -- a needle dipped in the ichor of poisonplant, hidden up his sleeve.  After the mortal blow, he collapsed forward and stuck Kazagh in the calf with the pin.  By the time he made it back to the Minegaur manorhouse, he was dying.""},{""text1"":""Vision blurring, he climbed up to the eaves of the house to Peliah's window and rapped.  Peliah did not answer immediately, as she was in a deep, wonderful sleep, dreaming about her future with her Khajiiti lover.  He rapped louder, which woke up not only Peliah, but also her father in the next room.""},{""text1"":""\""Kazagh!\"" she cried, opening up the window.  The next person in the bedroom was Minegaur himself.""},{""text1"":""As he saw it, this slave, his property, was about to lop off the head of his daughter, his property, with his sword, his property.  Suddenly, with the energy of a young man, Minegaur rushed at the dying Khajiit, knocking the sword out of his hand.  Before Peliah could stop him, her father had thrust the blade into her lover's heart.""},{""text1"":""The excitement over, the old man dropped the sword and turned to the door to call the Guard.  As an after thought, it occurred to him to make certain that his daughter hadn't been injured and might require a Healer.  Minegaur turned to her.  For a moment, he felt simply disoriented, feeling the force of the blow, but not the blade itself.  Then he saw the blood and then felt the pain.  Before he fully realized that his daughter had stabbed him with Akrash, he was dead.  The blade, at last, found its scabbard.""},{""text1"":""A week later, after the official investigations, the slave was buried in an unmarked grave in the manor field, and Serjo Dres Minegaur found his resting place in a modest corner of the family's opulent mausoleum.  A larger crowd of curious onlookers came to view the funeral of the noble slaver whose secret life was as the savage Lopper of his competitors.  The audience was respectfully quiet, though there was not a person there not imagining the final moments of the man's life.

What could she mean by such a conciliatory gesture?""},{""text"":""The dinner itself progressed along with perfect if slightly cool civility among all parties. Hiomaste and the Duchess were both very quiet. The Mayor tried to engage the group in a discussion of the Emperor Pelagius IV's new son and heir Uriel, but it failed to spark much interest. Lady Villea, elderly but much more vivacious than her sister the Duchess, led most of the talk about crime and scandal in Eldenroot.""},{""text"":""\""I have been encouraging her to move out to the country, away from all that unpleasantness for years now,\"" the Duchess said, meeting the eyes of the Mayor. \""We've been discussing more recently the possibility of her building a palace on Moliva Hill, but there's so little space there as you know. Fortunately, we've come to a discovery.

She obviously was not.""},{""text"":""\""Think of how much more commerce you could bring to your village if you were close to the river,\"" said Lady Villea jovially. \""And Master Hiomaste's students could have easier access to his fine school. Everyone would benefit. I know it would put my sister's heart to ease if there was less trespassing and poaching on her lands.\""""},{""text"":""\""There is no poaching or trespassing on your lands now, Your Grace,\"" frowned Hiomaste. \""You do not own the jungle, nor will you. The villagers may be persuaded to leave, that I don't know. But my school will stay where it is.\""""},{""text"":""The dinner party never really recovered happily. Hiomaste and the Mayor excused themselves, and my services, such as they were, were not needed in the drawing room where the group went to have their drinks. There was no laughter to be heard through the walls that evening.""},{""text"":""The next day, even though there was a dinner planned for the evening, I left on my usual walk to Moliva. Before I had even reached the drawbridge, the guard held me back: \""Where are you going, Gorgic? Not to the village, are you?\""""},{""text"":""\""Why not?\""""},{""text"":""He pointed to the plume of smoke in the distance: \""A fire broke out very early this morning, and it's still going. Apparently, it started at Master Hiomaste's school. It looks like the work of some traveling brigands.\""""},{""text"":""\""Blessed Stendarr!\"" I cried. \""Are the students alive?\""""},{""text"":""\""No one knows, but it'd be a miracle if any survived. It was late and most everyone was sleeping. I know they've already found the Master's body, or what was left of it. And they also found that girl, your friend, Prolyssa.\""""},{""text"":""I spent the day in a state of shock. It seemed inconceivable what my instinct told me: that the two noble old ladies, Lady Villea and the Duchess of Woda, had arranged for a village and school that irritated them to be reduced to ashes. At dinner, they mentioned the fire in Moliva only very briefly, as if it were not news at all. But I did see the Duchess smile for the first time ever. It was a smile I will never forget until the day I die.""},{""text"":""The next morning, I had resolved to go to the village and see if I could be of any assistance to the survivors. I was passing through the servants' hall to the grand foyer when I heard the sound of a group of people ahead. The guards and most of the servants were there, pointing at the portrait of the Duchess that hung in the center of the hall.""},{""text"":""There was a single black bolt of ebony piercing the painting, right at the Duchess's heart.""},{""text"":""I recognized it at once. It was one of Missun Akin's arrows I had seen in his quiver, forged, he said, in the bowels of Dagoth-Ur itself. My first reaction was relief: the Dunmer who had been kind enough to give me a ride to the palace had survived the fire. My second reaction was echoed by all present in the hall. How had the vandal gotten past the guards, the gate, the moat, and the massive iron door?""},{""text"":""The Duchess, arriving shortly after I, was clearly furious, though she was too well bred to show it but by raising her web-thin eyebrows. She wasted no time in assigning all her servants to new duties to keep the palace grounds guarded at all times. We were given regular shifts and precise, narrow patrols.""},{""text"":""The next morning, despite all precautions, there was another black arrow piercing the Duchess's portrait.""},{""text"":""So it continued for a week's time. The Duchess saw to it that at least one person was always present in the foyer, but somehow the arrow always found its way to her painting whenever the guard's eyes were momentarily averted.""},{""text"":""A complex series of signals were devised, so each patrol could report back any sounds or disturbances they encountered during their vigil. At first, the Duchess arranged them so her castellan would receive record of any disturbances during the day, and the chief of the guard during the night. But when she found that she could not sleep, she made certain that the information came to her directly.""},{""text"":""The atmosphere in the palace had shifted from gloomy to nightmarish. A snake would slither across the moat, and suddenly Her Grace would be tearing through the east wing to investigate. A strong gust of wind ruffling the leaves on one of the few trees in the lawn was a similar emergency. An unfortunate lone traveler on the road in front of the palace, a completely innocent man at it turned out, brought such a violent reaction that he must have thought that he had stumbled on a war. In a way, he had.""},{""text"":""And every morning, there was a new arrow in the front hall, mocking her.""},{""text"":""I was given the terrible assignment of guarding the portrait for a few hours in the early morning. Not wanting to be the one to discover the arrow, I seated myself in a chair opposite, never letting my eyes move away for even a second. I don't know if you've had the experience of watching one object relentlessly, but it has a strange effect. All other senses vanish. That was why I was particularly startled when the Duchess rushed into the room, blurring the gulf for me between her portrait and herself.""},{""text"":""\""There's something moving behind the tree across the road from the gate!\"" she roared, pushing me aside, and fumbling with her key in the gold lock.""},{""text"":""She was shaking with madness and excitement, and the key did not seem to want to go in. I reached out to help her, but the Duchess was already kneeling, her eye to the keyhole, to be certain that the key went through.""},{""text"":""It was precisely in that second that the arrow arrived, but this one never made it as far as the portrait.""},{""text"":""I actually met Missun Akin years later, while I was in Morrowind to entertain some nobles. He was impressed that I had risen from being a humble domestic servant to being a bard of some renown. He himself had returned to the ashlands, and, like his old master Hiomaste, was retired to the simple life of teaching and hunting.""},{""text"":""I told him that I had heard that Lady Villea had decided not to leave the city, and that the village of Modiva had been rebuilt. He was happy to hear that, but I could not find a way to ask him what I really wanted to know. I felt like a fool just wondering if what I thought were true, that he had been behind Prolyssa's tree across the road from the gate every morning that summer, firing an arrow through the gate, across the lawn, across the moat, through a keyhole, and into a portrait of the Duchess of Woda until he struck the Duchess herself. It was clearly an impossibility. I chose not to ask.""},{""text"":""As we left one another that day, and he was waving good-bye, he said, \""I am pleased to see you doing so well, my friend.

The villagers may be persuaded to leave, that I don't know. But my school will stay where it is.\""""},{""text1"":""The dinner party never really recovered happily. Hiomaste and the Mayor excused themselves, and my services, such as they were, were not needed in the drawing room where the group went to have their drinks. There was no laughter to be heard through the walls that evening.""},{""text1"":""The next day, even though there was a dinner planned for the evening, I left on my usual walk to Moliva. Before I had even reached the drawbridge, the guard held me back: \""Where are you going, Gorgic? Not to the village, are you?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Why not?\""""},{""text1"":""He pointed to the plume of smoke in the distance: \""A fire broke out very early this morning, and it's still going.

It was a smile I will never forget until the day I die.""},{""text1"":""The next morning, I had resolved to go to the village and see if I could be of any assistance to the survivors.

My first reaction was relief: the Dunmer who had been kind enough to give me a ride to the palace had survived the fire. My second reaction was echoed by all present in the hall. How had the vandal gotten past the guards, the gate, the moat, and the massive iron door?""},{""text1"":""The Duchess, arriving shortly after I, was clearly furious, though she was too well bred to show it but by raising her web-thin eyebrows. She wasted no time in assigning all her servants to new duties to keep the palace grounds guarded at all times. We were given regular shifts and precise, narrow patrols.""},{""text1"":""The next morning, despite all precautions, there was another black arrow piercing the Duchess's portrait.""},{""text1"":""So it continued for a week's time. The Duchess saw to it that at least one person was always present in the foyer, but somehow the arrow always found its way to her painting whenever the guard's eyes were momentarily averted.""},{""text1"":""A complex series of signals were devised, so each patrol could report back any sounds or disturbances they encountered during their vigil. At first, the Duchess arranged them so her castellan would receive record of any disturbances during the day, and the chief of the guard during the night. But when she found that she could not sleep, she made certain that the information came to her directly.""},{""text1"":""The atmosphere in the palace had shifted from gloomy to nightmarish. A snake would slither across the moat, and suddenly Her Grace would be tearing through the east wing to investigate. A strong gust of wind ruffling the leaves on one of the few trees in the lawn was a similar emergency. An unfortunate lone traveler on the road in front of the palace, a completely innocent man at it turned out, brought such a violent reaction that he must have thought that he had stumbled on a war. In a way, he had.""},{""text1"":""And every morning, there was a new arrow in the front hall, mocking her.""},{""text1"":""I was given the terrible assignment of guarding the portrait for a few hours in the early morning. Not wanting to be the one to discover the arrow, I seated myself in a chair opposite, never letting my eyes move away for even a second. I don't know if you've had the experience of watching one object relentlessly, but it has a strange effect. All other senses vanish. That was why I was particularly startled when the Duchess rushed into the room, blurring the gulf for me between her portrait and herself.""},{""text1"":""\""There's something moving behind the tree across the road from the gate!\"" she roared, pushing me aside, and fumbling with her key in the gold lock.""},{""text1"":""She was shaking with madness and excitement, and the key did not seem to want to go in. I reached out to help her, but the Duchess was already kneeling, her eye to the keyhole, to be certain that the key went through.""},{""text1"":""It was precisely in that second that the arrow arrived, but this one never made it as far as the portrait.""},{""text1"":""I actually met Missun Akin years later, while I was in Morrowind to entertain some nobles. He was impressed that I had risen from being a humble domestic servant to being a bard of some renown. He himself had returned to the ashlands, and, like his old master Hiomaste, was retired to the simple life of teaching and hunting.""},{""text1"":""I told him that I had heard that Lady Villea had decided not to leave the city, and that the village of Modiva had been rebuilt. He was happy to hear that, but I could not find a way to ask him what I really wanted to know. I felt like a fool just wondering if what I thought were true, that he had been behind Prolyssa's tree across the road from the gate every morning that summer, firing an arrow through the gate, across the lawn, across the moat, through a keyhole, and into a portrait of the Duchess of Woda until he struck the Duchess herself. It was clearly an impossibility. I chose not to ask.""},{""text1"":""As we left one another that day, and he was waving good-bye, he said, \""I am pleased to see you doing so well, my friend.

In Elsweyr, it is common for the shop-owner to offer the prospective buyer tea or sweetmeats and engage in polite conversation before commencing the business. This eminently civilized tradition has a practical purpose, allowing the buyer to observe the wares for sale.

The laboratory was never found or even detected by the Reform.""},{""text1"":""Much time passed.

Wayrest had been showered by much preference during the years before Pelagius' birth, for King Magnus was Antiochus' favorite brother.""},{""text1"":""It is hard to say when Pelagius' madness first manifested itself, for, in truth, the first ten years of his life were marked by much insanity in the land itself. When Pelagius was just over a year old, Antiochus died and a daughter, Kintyra, assumed the throne to the acclaim of all. Kintyra II was Pelagius' cousin and an accomplished mystic and sorceress. If she had sufficient means to peer into the future, she would have surely fled the palace.""},{""text1"":""The story of the War of the Red Diamond has been told in many other scholarly journals, but as most historians agree, Kintyra II's reign was usurped by her and Pelagius' cousin Uriel, by the power of his mother, Potema -- the so-called wolf queen of Solitude. The year after her coronation, Kintyra was trapped in Glenpoint and imprisoned in the Imperial dungeons there.""},{""text1"":""All of Tamriel exploded into warfare as Prince Uriel took the throne as Uriel III, and High Rock, because of the imprisoned Empress' presence there, was the location of some of the bloodiest battles. Pelagius' father, King Magnus, allied himself with his brother Cephorus against the usurper Emperor, and brought the wrath of Uriel III and Queen Potema down on Wayrest. Pelagius, his brothers and sisters, and his mother Utheilla fled to the Isle of Balfiera. Utheilla was of the line of Direnni, and her family manse is still located on that ancient isle even to this day.""},{""text1"":""There is thankfully much written record of Pelagius' childhood in Balfiera recorded by nurses and visitors. All who met him described him as a handsome, personable boy, interested in sport, magic, and music. Even assuming diplomats' lack of candor, Pelagius seemed, if anything, a blessing to the future of the Septim Dynasty.""},{""text1"":""When Pelagius was eight, Cephorus slew Uriel III at the Battle of Ichidag and proclaimed himself Emperor Cephorus I. For the next ten years of his reign, Cephorus battled Potema. Pelagius' first battle was the Siege of Solitude, which ended with Potema's death and the final end of the war. In gratitude, Cephorus placed Pelagius on the throne of Solitude.""},{""text1"":""As king of Solitude, Pelagius' eccentricities of behavior began to be noticeable. As a favorite nephew of the Emperor, few diplomats to Solitude made critical commentary about Pelagius. For the first two years of his reign, Pelagius was at the very least noted for his alarming shifts in weight. Four months after taking the throne, a diplomat from Ebonheart called Pelagius \""a hale and hearty soul with a heart so big, it widens his waist\""; five months after that, the visiting princess of Firsthold wrote to her brother that \""the king's gripped my hand and it felt like I was being clutched by a skeleton. Pelagius is greatly emaciated, indeed.\""""},{""text1"":""Cephorus never married and died childless three years after the Siege of Solitude. As the only surviving sibling, Pelagius' father Magnus left the throne of Wayrest and took residence at the Imperial City as the Emperor Magnus I. Magnus was elderly and Pelagius was his oldest living child, so the attention of Tamriel focused on Sentinel. By this time, Pelagius' eccentricities were becoming infamous.""},{""text1"":""There are many legends about his acts as King of Sentinel, but few well-documented cases exist. It is known that Pelagius locked the young princes and princesses of Silvenar in his room with him, only releasing them when an unsigned Declaration of War was slipped under the door. When he tore off his clothes during a speech he was giving at a local festival, his advisors apparently decided to watch him more carefully. On the orders of Magnus, Pelagius was married to the beautiful heiress of an ancient Dark Elf noble family, Katariah Ra'athim.""},{""text1"":""Nordic kings who marry Dark Elves seldom improve their popularity. There are two reasons most scholars give for the union. Magnus was trying to cement relations with Ebonheart, where the Ra'athim clan hailed. Ebonheart's neighbor, Mournhold, had been a historical ally of the Empire since the very beginning, and the royal consort of Queen Barenziah had won many battles in the War of the Red Diamond. Ebonheart had a poorly-kept secret of aiding Uriel III and Potema.""},{""text1"":""The other reason for the marriage was more personal: Katariah was as shrewd a diplomat as she was beautiful. If any creature was capable of hiding Pelagius' madness, it was she.""},{""text1"":""On the 8th of Second Seed, 3E 145, Magnus I died quietly in his sleep. Jolethe, Pelagius' sister took over the throne of Solitude, and Pelagius and Katariah rode to the Imperial City to be crowned Emperor and Empress of Tamriel. It is said that Pelagius fainted when the crown was placed on his head, but Katariah held him up so only those closest to the thrones could see what had happened. Like so many Pelagius stories, this cannot be verified.""},{""text1"":""Pelagius III never truly ruled Tamriel. Katariah and the Elder Council made all the decisions and only tried to keep Pelagius from embarrassing all. Still, stories of Pelagius III's reign exist.""},{""text1"":""It was said that when the Argonian ambassador from Blackrose came to court, Pelagius insisted on speaking in all grunts and squeaks, as that was the Argonian's natural language.""},{""text1"":""It is known that Pelagius was obsessed with cleanliness, and many guests reported waking to the noise of an early-morning scrubdown of the Imperial Palace. The legend of Pelagius while inspecting the servants' work, suddenly defecating on the floor to give them something to do, is probably apocryphal.""},{""text1"":""When Pelagius began actually biting and attacking visitors to the Imperial Palace, it was decided to send him to a private asylum. Katariah was proclaimed regent two years after Pelagius took the throne. For the next six years, the Emperor stayed in a series of institutions and asylums.""},{""text1"":""Traitors to the Empire have many lies to spread about this period. Whispered stories of hideous experiments and tortures performed on Pelagius have almost become accepted as fact. The noble lady Katariah became pregnant shortly after the Emperor was sent away, and rumors of infidelity and, even more absurd, conspiracies to keep the sane Emperor locked away, ran amok. As Katariah proved, her pregnancy came about after a visit to her husband's cell. With no other evidence, as loyal subjects, we are bound to accept the Empress' word on the matter. Her second child, who would reign for many years as Uriel IV, was the child of her union with her consort Lariate, and publicly acknowledged as such.""},{""text1"":""On a warm night in Suns Dawn, in his 34th year, Pelagius III died after a brief fever in his cell at the Temple of Kynareth in the Isle of Betony. Katariah I reigned for another forty six years before passing the scepter onto the only child she had with Pelagius, Cassynder.""},{""text1"":""Pelagius' wild behavior has made him perversely dear to the province of his birth and death. The 2nd of Suns Dawn, which may or may not be the anniversary of his death (records are not very clear) is celebrated as Mad Pelagius, the time when foolishness of all sorts is encouraged. And so, one of the least desirable Emperors in the history of the Septim Dynasty, has become one of the most famous ones.""},{""text1"":"" ""}]"

There were some who said that he moved faster while wearing armor than he did out of it.""},{""text1"":""\""Some months before this story begins, he had won the daughter of one of his neighbors, a beautiful creature named Mena who he had made his wife.  He loved her very much, but he was intensely jealous, and with good reason.  She wasn't very pleased with his husbandly skills, and the only reason Mena never strayed was because Pasoroth kept a close eye on her.  She was, to put it kindly, naturally amorous and resentful of her position as a prize.  Wherever he went, he always brought her with him.  At the games, she was placed in a special box so that he could see her even while he competed.""},{""text1"":""\""But his real competition, though he didn't know it, was from a handsome young armorer he also had won at one of his competitions.

Perhaps because of this, it became a burning obsession to both of them.  Taren decided that the best time for them to consummate their love was during the games.  Mena feigned illness, so she didn't have to stay in the box, but Pasoroth visited the sickroom every few minutes between fights, so Taren and Mena could never get together.  The sound of Pasoroth's armor clunking up the stairs to visit his sick wife gave Taren the idea.""},{""text1"":""\""He crafted his lord a new suit of armor, strong, and bright, and beautifully decorated.  For his purposes, Taren rubbed the leg joints with luca dust so the more he sweated and the more he moved them, the more they'd stick together.  After a little while, Taren figured, Pasoroth wouldn't be able to walk very quickly, and wouldn't have enough time in between fights to visit his wife.  But just in case, Taren also added bells to the legs which rung loudly when they moved, so the couple would be able to hear him coming in plenty of time.""},{""text1"":""\""When the games commenced the following week, Mena feigned illness again and Taren presented his lord with the new armor.  Pasoroth was delighted with it, as Taren hoped he would be, and donned it for his first fight.  Taren then stole upstairs to Mena's bedchamber.""},{""text1"":""\""All was silent outside as the two began to make love.  Suddenly, Mena noticed a peculiar expression on Taren's face and before she had a chance to ask him about it, his head fell off at the neck.

These tone-shades  are then imprinted upon the substance of the wearer of Wraithguard,  giving him an immortal and divine nature.""},{""text1"":""The Nerevarine will not be taught the secret rituals required to perform  the third step. Instead, The Nerevarine will strike the Heart with  Keening for a second time, causing its tones to diverge into unstable  patterns of interference.

Destroying Kagrenac's enchantments  on the Heart will also stop the corrupt effusion of the Heart's divine  power, and end the Blight on Morrowind.""},{""text1"":""The Nerevarine may be tempted to steal the power of the Heart. Dagoth Ur  and Sotha Sil alone know this secret. Dagoth Ur may, in extremity,  propose to teach the Nerevarine to use Kagrenac's tools to become a god.

Further, advancement in House  Dagoth, as in all Great Houses, is by challenge and confrontation within  the hierarchy. The Nerevarine's challenges and defeats of ash vampires  and battles with the Sixth House will be viewed in that light.""},{""text1"":""Dagoth Ur and his kin may assume The Nerevarine's ambition is to control  the Heart.

She was a comely lass, a scholar, a great athlete, but dour and brooding in aspect. This personality defect did not bother her potential suitors any more than her positive traits impressed them.

The young man, who no one had ever heard of, arrived in a shining ebon coach drawn by a team of dragons, his clothing of rarest manufacture, and accompanied by an army of the most fantastical servants any of Gunal had ever seen.

The first vault had to be opened by touching a series of runic symbols: should one of the marks be mispressed, a volley of poisoned arrows would have struck the thief.

Amused, Juilek watched them run until he overheard the name of \""Vivec.\""""},{""text1"":""\""My Lord Vivec,\"" he said, bursting into the back room. \""You must believe me, I knew nothing about the attack on Black Gate until after it happened.  We will, of course, be returning it to your care forthwith.  I wrote you a letter to that effect at your palace in Balmora, but obviously you're not there,\"" he paused, taking in the many new faces in the room. \""I'm sorry, let me introduce myself.  I'm Juilek Cyrodiil.\""""},{""text1"":""\""My name is Almalexia,\"" said the most beautiful woman the Prince had ever seen. \""Won't you join us?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Sotha Sil,\"" said a serious-looking Dunmer in a white cloak, shaking the Prince's hand and showing him to a seat.""},{""text1"":""\""Indoril Brindisi Dorom, Duke-Prince of Mournhold,\"" said the massively-built man next to him as he sat down.""},{""text1"":""\""I recognize that the events of the last month suggest, at best, that the Imperial Army is not under my control,\"" said the Prince after ordering some wine. \""This is true.  The army is my father's.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I understood that the Emperor was going to be coming to Ald Lambasi as well,\"" said Almalexia.""},{""text1"":""\""Officially, he is,\"" said the Prince cautiously. \""Unofficially, he's still back in the Imperial City.  He's met with an unfortunate accident.\""""},{""text1"":""Vivec glanced the Duke quickly before looking at the Prince: \""An accident?\""""},{""text1"":""\""He's fine,\"" said the Prince quickly. \""He'll live, but it looks like he'll lose an eye. It was an altercation that has nothing to do with the war. The only good news is that while he recovers, I have the use of his seal.  Any agreement we make here and now will be binding to the Empire, both in my father's reign and in mine.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Then let's start agreeing,\"" smiled Almalexia.""},{""text1"":""The tiny hamlet of Wroth Naga greeted Cassyr with its colorful houses perched on a promontory overlooking the stretch of the Wrothgarian mountain plain and High Rock beyond.  Had he been in a better mood, the sight would have been breathtaking.  As it was, he could only think that in practical terms, a small village like this would have meager provisions for himself and his horse.""},{""text1"":""He rode down into the main square, where an inn called the Eagle's Cry stood.  Directing the stable boy to house and feed his horse, Cassyr walked into the inn and was surprised by its ambience.  A minstrel he had heard play once in Gilderdale was performing a jaunty old tune to the clapping of the mountain men.  Such forced merriment was not what Cassyr wanted at that moment.  A glum Dunmer woman was seated at the only table far from the noise, so he took his drink there and sat down without invitation.  It was only when he did so that he noticed that she was holding a newborn baby.""},{""text1"":""\""I've just come from Morrowind,\"" he said rather awkwardly, lowering his voice. \""I've been fighting for Vivec and the Duke of Mournhold against the Imperial army.  A traitor to my people, I guess you'd call me.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I am also a traitor to my people,\"" said the woman, holding up her hand which was scarred with a branded symbol. \""It means that I can never go back to my homeland.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Well, you're not thinking of staying here, are you?\"" laughed Cassyr. \""It's certainly quaint, but come wintertide, there's going to be snow up to your eyelashes.  It's no place for a new baby.  What is her name?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Bosriel.  It means 'Beauty of the Forest.' Where are you going?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Dwynnen, on the bay in High Rock.  You're welcome to join me, I could use the company.\"" He held out his hand. \""Cassyr Whitley.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Turala,\"" said the woman after a pause.  She was going to use her family's name first, as is tradition, but she realized that it was no longer her name. \""I would love to accompany you, thank you.\""""},{""text1"":""Five men and two women stood in the silence of the Great Room of the castle, the only sound the scrawl of quill on parchment and the gentle tapping of rain on the large picture window.  As the Prince set the seal of Cyrodiil on the document, the peace was made official.  The Duke of Mournhold broke out in a roar of delight, ordering wine brought in to commemorate the end of eighty years of war.""},{""text1"":""Only Sotha Sil stood apart from the group.  His face betrayed no emotion.  Those who knew him best knew he did not believe in endings or beginnings, but in the continuous cycle of which this was but a small part.""},{""text1"":""\""My Prince,\"" said the castle steward, unhappy at breaking the celebration. \""There is a messenger here from your mother, the Empress.  He asked to see your father, but as he did not arrive --\""""},{""text1"":""Juilek excused himself and went to speak with the messenger.""},{""text1"":""\""The Empress does not live in the Imperial City?\"" asked Vivec.""},{""text1"":""\""No,\"" said Almalexia, shaking her head sadly. \""Her husband has imprisoned her in Black Marsh, fearing that she was plotting a revolution against him.  She is extremely wealthy and has powerful allies in the western Colovian estates so he could not marry another or have her executed.  They've been at an impasse for the last seventeen years since Juilek was a child.\""""},{""text1"":""The Prince returned a few minutes later.  His face betrayed his anxiety, though he took troubles to hide it.""},{""text1"":""\""My mother needs me,\"" he said simply. \""I'm afraid I must leave at once.

As they watched him ride out into the rainswept night south towards Black Marsh, Vivec said, \""Tamriel will be much healed when he has the throne.\""""},{""text1"":""The moon was rising over the desolate quarry, steaming with swamp gas from a particularly hot summer as the Prince and his two guard escort rode out of the forest.  The massive piles of earth and dung had been piled high in antiquity by some primitive, long-dead tribe of Black Marsh, hoping to keep out some evil from the north.  Evidently, the evil had broken through at Dorsza Pass, the large crack in the sad, lonely rampart that stretched for miles.""},{""text1"":""The black twisted trees that grew on the barrier cast strange shadows down, like a net tangling.  The Prince's mind was on his mother's cryptic letter, hinting at the threat of an invasion.  He could not, of course, tell the Dunmer about it, at the very least until he knew more and had notified his father.  After all, the letter was meant for him.  It was its urgent tone that made him decide to go directly to Gideon.""},{""text1"":""The Empress had also warned him about a band of former slaves who attacked caravans going into Dorsza Pass.  She advised him to be certain to make his Imperial shield visible, so they would know he was not one of the hated Dunmer slavers.  Upon riding into the tall weeds that flooded through the pass like a noxious river, the Prince ordered that his shield be displayed.""},{""text1"":""\""I can see why the slaves use this,\"" said the Prince's captain. \""It's an excellent location for an ambush.\""""},{""text1"":""Juilek nodded his head, but his thoughts were elsewhere.  What threat of invasion could the Empress have discovered?  Were the Akaviri on the seas again?  If so, how could his mother from her cell in Castle Giovese know of it?  A rustle in the weeds and a single sharp human cry behind him interrupted his ponderings.""},{""text1"":""Turning around, the Prince discovered that he was alone.  His escort had vanished.""},{""text1"":""The Prince peered over the stretch of the moonlit sea of grass which waved in almost hypnotic patterns to the ebb and flow of the night wind billowing through the pass.  It was impossible to tell if a struggling soldier was beneath this system of vibrations, a dying horse behind another.  A high, whistling wind drowned out any sound the victims of the ambush might be making.""},{""text1"":""Juilek drew his sword, and thought about what to do, his mind willing his heart not to panic.  He was closer to the exit of the pass than the entrance. Whatever had slain his escort must have been behind him.  If he rode fast enough, perhaps he could outrun it.  Spurring his horse to gallop, he charged for the hills ahead, framed by the mighty black piles of dirt.""},{""text1"":""When he was thrown, it happened so suddenly, he was hurdling forward before he was truly conscious of the fact.  He landed several yards beyond where his horse had fallen, breaking his shoulder and his back on impact.  A numbness washed over him as he stared at his poor, dying steed, its belly sliced open by one of several spears jutting up just below the surface of the grass.""},{""text1"":""Prince Juilek was not able to turn and face the figure that emerged from the grass, nor able to move to defend himself.  His throat was cut without ceremony.""},{""text1"":""Miramor cursed when he saw the face of his victim more clearly in the moonlight.  He had seen the Emperor at the Battle of Bodrum when he had fought in His Imperial Majesty's command, and this was clearly not the Emperor.  Searching the body, he found the letter and a treaty signed by Vivec, Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and the Duke of Mournhold representing Morrowind and the Prince Juilek Cyrodiil, representing the Cyrodiil Empire.""},{""text1"":""\""Curse my luck,\"" muttered Miramor to himself and the whispering grass. \""I've only killed a Prince.  Where's the reward in that?\""""},{""text1"":""Miramor destroyed the letter, as Zuuk had instructed him to do, and pocketed the treaty.  At the very least, such a curiosity would have some market value.  He disassembled the traps as he pondered his next step.  Return to Gideon and ask his employer for a lesser reward for killing the heir?  Move on to other lands?  At the very least, he considered, he had picked up two useful skills from the Battle of Bodrum.  From the Dunmer, he had learned the excellent spear trap.  And abandoning the Imperial army, he had learned how to skulk in the grass.""},{""text1"":""The Year is Continued in Hearth Fire.""},{""text1"":""Hearth Fire\nBook Nine of 2920 \nThe Last Year of the First Era""},{""text1"":""\nby\nCarlovac Townway""},{""text1"":""The Empress Tavia lay across her bed, a hot late summer wind she could not feel banging the shutters of her cell to and fro against the iron bars.  Her throat felt like it was on fire but still she sobbed, uncontrollably, wringing her last tapestry in her hands.  Her wailing echoed throughout the hollow halls of Castle Giovese, stopping maids in their washing and guards in their conversation.  One of her women came up the narrow stairs to see her mistress, but her chief guard Zuuk stood at the doorway and shook his head.""},{""text1"":""\""She's just heard that her son is dead,\"" he said quietly.""},{""text1"":""\""Your Imperial Majesty,\"" said the Potentate Versidue-Shaie through the door. \""You can open the door.

Reman opened the door just a crack, but the Potentate could see his angry, fearful face, and the terrible mound of ripped tissue that used to be his right eye.  Despite the best healers in the Empire, it was still a ghastly souvenir of the Lady Rijja's work in Thurzo Fortress.""},{""text1"":""\""Hand me the order,\"" the Emperor snarled. \""I'll sign it with pleasure.\""""},{""text1"":""The strange blue glow of the will o' the wisps, a combination, so she'd be told, of swamp gas and spiritual energy, had always frightened Tavia as she looked out her window.  Now it seemed strangely comforting.  Beyond the bog lay the city of Gideon.  It was funny, she thought, that she had never stepped foot in its streets, though she had watched it ever day for seventeen years.""},{""text1"":""\""Can you think of anything I've forgotten?\"" she asked, turning to look back on the loyal Kothringi Zuuk.""},{""text1"":""\""I know exactly what to do,\"" he said simply.

She was smiling, and she didn't even realize it.""},{""text1"":""\""Make certain you aren't followed,\"" she warned. \""I don't want my husband to know where my gold's been hiding all these years.  And do take your share of it.  You've been a good friend.\""""},{""text1"":""The Empress Tavia stepped forward and dropped from sight into the mists.  Zuuk replaced the bars on the tower window, and threw a blanket over some pillows on her bed.  With any luck, they would not discover her body on the lawn until morning, at which time he hoped to be halfway to Morrowind.""},{""text1"":""The strange trees on all sides resembled knobby piles crowned with great bursts of reds, yellows, and oranges, like insect mounds caught fire.  The Wrothgarian mountains were fading into the misty afternoon.  Turala marveled at the sight, so alien, so different from Morrowind, as she plodded the horse forward into an open pasture.  Behind her, head nodding against his chest, Cassyr slept, cradling Bosriel.  For a moment, Turala considered jumping the low painted fence that crossed the field, but she thought better of it.  Let Cassyr sleep for a few more hours before giving him the reigns.""},{""text1"":""As the horse passed into the field, Turala saw the small green house on the next hill, half-hidden in forest.  So picturesque was the image, she felt herself lull into a pleasant half-sleeping state.  A blast of a horn brought her back to reality with a shudder.  Cassyr opened his eyes.""},{""text1"":""\""Where are we?\"" he hissed.""},{""text1"":""\""I don't know,\"" Turala stammered, wide-eyed. \""What is that sound?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Orcs,\"" he whispered. \""A hunting party.  Head for the thicket quickly.\""""},{""text1"":""Turala trotted the horse into the small collection of trees. Cassyr handed her the child and dismounted.  He began pulling their bags off next, throwing them into the bushes.  A sound started then, a distant rumbling of footfall, growing louder and closer.  Turala climbed off carefully and helped Cassyr unburden the horse.  All the while, Bosriel watched open-eyed.  Turala sometimes worried that her baby never cried.  Now she was grateful for it.  With the last of the luggage off, Cassyr slapped the horse's rear, sending it galloping into the field.  Taking Turala's hand, he hunkered down in the bushes.""},{""text1"":""\""With luck,\"" he murmured. \""They'll think she's wild or belongs to the farm and won't go looking for the rider.\""""},{""text1"":""As he spoke, a horde of orcs surged into the field, blasting their horns.  Turala had seen orcs before, but never in such abundance, never with such bestial confidence.  Roaring with delight at the horse and its confused state, they hastened past the timber where Cassyr, Turala, and Bosriel hid.  The wildflowers flew into the air at their stampede, powdering the air with seeds.  Turala tried to hold back a sneeze, and thought she succeeded.  One of the orcs heard something though, and brought another with him to investigate.""},{""text1"":""Cassyr quietly unsheathed his sword, mustering all the confidence he could.  His skills, such as they were, were in spying, not combat, but he vowed to protect Turala and her babe for as long as he could.  Perhaps he would slay these two, he reasoned, but not before they cried out and brought the rest of the horde.""},{""text1"":""Suddenly, something invisible swept through the bushes like a wind.  The orcs flew backwards, falling dead on their backs.  Turala turned and saw a wrinkled crone with bright red hair emerge from a nearby bush.""},{""text1"":""\""I thought you were going to bring 'em right to me,\"" she whispered, smiling. \""Best come with me.\""""},{""text1"":""The three followed the old woman through a deep crevasse of bramble bushes that ran through the field toward the house on the hill.  As they emerged on the other side, the woman turned to look at the orcs feasting on the remains of the horse, a blood-soaked orgy to the beat of multiple horns.""},{""text1"":""\""That horse yours?\"" she asked.  When Cassyr nodded, she laughed loudly. \""That's rich meat, that is.  Those monsters'll have bellyaches and flatulence in the morning.  Serves 'em right.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Shouldn't we keep moving?\"" whispered Turala, unnerved by the woman's laughter.""},{""text1"":""\""They won't come up here,\"" she grinned, looking at Bosriel who smiled back. \""They're too afraid of us.\""""},{""text1"":""Turala turned to Cassyr, who shook his head. \""Witches.  Am I correct in assuming that this is Old Barbyn's Farm, the home of the Skeffington Coven?\""""},{""text1"":""\""You are, pet,\"" the old woman giggled girlishly, pleased to be so infamous. \""I am Mynista Skeffington.\""""},{""text1"":""\""What did you do to those orcs?\"" asked Turala. \""Back there in the thicket?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Spirit fist right side the head,\"" Mynista said, continuing the climb up the hill.  Ahead of them was the farmhouse grounds, a well, a chicken coop, a pond, women of all ages doing chores, the laughter of children at play.  The old woman turned and saw that Turala did not understand. \""Don't you have witches where you come from, child?\""""},{""text1"":""\""None that I know of,\"" she said.""},{""text1"":""\""There are all sorts of wielders of magic in Tamriel,\"" she explained. \""The Psijics study magic like its their painful duty.  The battlemages in the army on the other end of the scale hurl spells like arrows.  We witches commune and conjure and celebrate.  To fell those orcs, I merely whispered to the spirits of the air, Amaro, Pina, Tallatha, the fingers of Kynareth, and the breath of the world, with whom I have an intimate acquaintance, to smack those bastards dead.  You see, conjuration is not about might, or solving riddles, or agonizing over musty old scrolls.  It's about fostering relations.  Being friendly, you might say.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Well, we certainly appreciate you being friendly with us,\"" said Cassyr.""},{""text1"":""\""As well you might,\"" coughed Mynista. \""Your kind destroyed the orc homeland two thousand years ago.  Before that, they never came all the way up here and bothered us.

She could not see the Potentate Versidue-Shaie, his coil neatly wrapped beneath him, a look of triumph in his golden face.  She could feel, numbly, the executioner's hand touch her back to steady her.

The Baron of Dwynnen had released him from his contract.  No doubt they were laughing about him in Daggerfall, too, and Dawnstar, Lilmoth, Rimmen, Greenheart, probably in Akavir and Yokuda for that matter.

He is generally considered to be the first of the Gods to form in the Beginning Place; after his establishment, other spirits found the process of being easier and the various pantheons of the world emerged. He is the ultimate God of the Cyrodilic Empire, where he embodies the qualities of endurance, invincibility, and everlasting legitimacy.""},{""text1"":""Alduin (World Eater): Alduin is the Nordic variation of Akatosh, and only superficially resembles his counterpart in the Nine Divines. For example, Alduin's sobriquet, 'the world eater', comes from myths that depict him as the horrible, ravaging firestorm that destroyed the last world to begin this one. Nords therefore see the god of time as both creator and harbinger of the apocalypse. He is not the chief of the Nordic pantheon (in fact, that pantheon has no chief; see Shor, below) but its wellspring, albeit a grim and frightening one.""},{""text1"":""Alkosh (Dragon King of Cats): Pre-ri'Datta Dynasty Anaquinine deity. A variation on the Altmeri Auri-El, and thus an Akatosh-as-culture-hero for the earliest Khajiiti. His worship was co-opted during the establishment of the Riddle-T'har, and he still enjoys immense popularity in Elsweyr's wasteland regions. He is depicted as a fearsome dragon, a creature the Khajiit say 'is just a real big cat'. He repelled an early Aldmeri pogrom of Pelinal Whitestrake during mythic times.""},{""text1"":""Almalexia (Mother Morrowind): Most traces of Akatosh disappeared from ancient Chimer legends during their so-called 'exodus', primarily due to that god's association and esteem with the Altmeri. However, most aspects of Akatosh which seem so important to the mortal races, namely immortality, historicity, and genealogy, have conveniently resurfaced in Almalexia, the most popular of Morrowind's divine Tribunal.""},{""text1"":""Arkay (God of the Cycle of Life and Death): Member of the Nine Divines pantheon, and popular elsewhere as well. Arkay is often more important in those cultures where his father, Akatosh, is either less related to time or where his time aspects are difficult to comprehend by the layman. He is the god of burials and funeral rites, and is sometimes associated with the seasons. His priests are staunch opponents of necromancy and all forms of the undead. It is said that Arkay did not exist before the world was created by the gods under Lorkhan's supervision/urging/trickery. Therefore, he is sometimes called the Mortals' God.""},{""text1"":""Auri-El (King of the Aldmer): The Elven Akatosh is Auri-El. Auri-El is the soul of Anui-El, who, in turn, is the soul of Anu the Everything. He is the chief of most Aldmeri pantheons. Most Altmeri and Bosmeri claim direct descent from Auri-El. In his only known moment of weakness, he agreed to take his part in the creation of the mortal plane, that act which forever sundered the Elves from the spirit worlds of eternity. To make up for it, Auri-El led the original Aldmer against the armies of Lorkhan in mythic times, vanquishing that tyrant and establishing the first kingdoms of the Altmer, Altmora and Old Ehlnofey. He then ascended to heaven in full observance of his followers so that they might learn the steps needed to escape the mortal plane.""},{""text1"":""Azura (Goddess of Dusk and Dawn): Azura was the god-ancestor that taught the Chimer the mysteries needed to be different than the Altmer. Some of her more conventional teachings are sometimes attributed to Boethiah. In the stories, Azura is often more a communal cosmic force for the race as a whole than an ancestor or a god. Also known as the Anticipation of Sotha Sil. In Elsweyr, Azurah is nearly a wholly separate entity, yet she is still tied into the origins of Khajiiti out of Altmeri stock.""},{""text1"":""Baan Dar (The Bandit God): In most regions, Baan Dar is a marginal diety, a trickster spirit of thieves and beggars. In Elsweyr he is more important, and is regarded as the Pariah. In this aspect, Baan Dar becomes the cleverness or desperate genius of the long-suffering Khajiit, whose last minute plans always upset the machinations of their (Elven or Human) enemies.""},{""text1"":""Boethiah (Prince of Plots): Heralded by the Prophet Veloth, Boethiah is the original god-ancestor of the Dark Elves. Through his illuminations, the eventual 'Chimer', or Changed Folk, renounced all ties to the Aldmer and founded a new nation based on Daedric principles. All manner of Dark Elven cultural 'advances' are attributed to Boethiah, from philosophy to magic to 'responsible' architecture. Ancient Velothi allegories are uniformly heroic successes of Boethiah over enemies of every type, foundation stories of Chimeri struggle. Also known as the Anticipation of Almalexia.""},{""text1"":""Diagna (Orichalc God of the Sideways Blade): Hoary thuggish cult of the Redguards. Originated in Yokuda during the Twenty Seven Snake Folk Slaughter. Diagna was an avatar of the HoonDing (the Yokudan God of Make Way, see below) that achieved permanence. He was instrumental to the defeat of the Lefthanded Elves, as he brought orichalc weapons to the Yokudan people to win the fight. In Tamriel, he led a very tight knit group of followers against the Orcs of Orsinium during the height of their ancient power, but then faded into obscurity. He is now little more than a local power spirit of the Dragontail mountains.""},{""text1"":""Dibella (Goddess of Beauty): Popular god of the Nine Divines. In Cyrodiil, she has nearly a dozen different cults, some devoted to women, some to artists and aesthetics, and others to erotic instruction.""},{""text1"":""Herma-Mora (The Woodland Man): Ancient Atmoran demon who, at one time, nearly seduced the Nords into becoming Aldmer. Most Ysgramor myths are about escaping the wiles of old Herma-Mora. Also called the Demon of Knowledge, he is vaguely related to the cult origins of the Morag Tong ('Foresters Guild'), if only by association with his brother/sister, Mephala.""},{""text1"":""HoonDing (The Make Way God): Yokudan spirit of 'perseverance over infidels'. The HoonDing has historically materialized whenever the Redguards need to 'make way' for their people. In Tamrielic history this has only happened three times -- twice in the first era during the Ra Gada invasion and once during the Tiber War. In this last incarnation, the HoonDing was said to have been either a sword or a crown, or both.""},{""text1"":""Jhunal (Rune God): The Nordic god of hermetic orders. After falling out of favor with the rest of that pantheon, he became Julianos of the Nine Divines. He is absent in modern Skyrim mythology.""},{""text1"":""Jode (Big Moon God): Aldmeri god of the Big Moon. Also called Masser or Mara's Tear. In Khajiti religion, Jode is only one aspect of the Lunar Lattice, or ja-Kha'jay.""},{""text1"":""Jone (Little Moon God): Aldmeri god of the Little Moon. Also called Secunda or Stendarr's Sorrow. In Khajiti religion, Jone is only one aspect of the Lunar Lattice, or ja-Kha'jay.""},{""text1"":""Julianos (God of Wisdom and Logic): Often associated with Jhunal, the Nordic father of language and mathematics, Julianos is the Cyrodilic god of literature, law, history, and contradiction. Monastic orders founded by Tiber Septim and dedicated to Julianos are the keepers of the Elder Scrolls.""},{""text1"":""Kyne (Kiss At the End): Nordic Goddess of the Storm. Widow of Shor and favored god of warriors. She is often called the Mother of Men. Her daughters taught the first Nords the use of the thu'um, or Storm Voice.""},{""text1"":""Kynareth (Goddess of Air): Kynareth is a member of the Nine Divines, the strongest of the Sky spirits. In some legends, she is the first to agree to Lorkhan's plan to invent the mortal plane, and provides the space for its creation in the void. She is also associated with rain, a phenomenon said not to occur before the removal of Lorkhan's divine spark.""},{""text1"":""Leki (Saint of the Spirit Sword): Goddess daughter of Tall Papa, Leki is the goddess of aberrant swordsmanship. The Na-Totambu of Yokuda warred to a standstill during the mythic era to decide who would lead the charge against the Lefthanded Elves. Their swordmasters, though, were so skilled in the Best Known Cuts as to be matched evenly. Leki introduced the Ephemeral Feint. Afterwards, a victor emerged and the war with the Aldmer began.""},{""text1"":""Lorkhan (The Missing God): This Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every Tamrielic mythic tradition. His most popular name is the Aldmeri 'Lorkhan', or Doom Drum. He convinced or contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of the mortal plane, upsetting the status quo -- much like his father Padomay had introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the world is materialized, Lorkhan is separated from his divine center, sometimes involuntarily, and wanders the creation of the et'Ada. He and his metaphysical placement in the 'scheme of things' is interpreted a variety of ways. In Morrowind, for example, he is a being related to the Psijiic Endeavor, a process by which mortals are charged with transcending the gods that created them. To the High Elves, he is the most unholy of all higher powers, as he forever broke their connection to the spirit plane. In the legends, he is almost always an enemy of the Aldmer and, therefore, a hero of early Mankind.""},{""text1"":""Lorkhaj (Moon Beast): Pre-ri'Datta Dynasty Anaquinine deity, easily identified with the Missing God, Lorkhan.""},{""text1"":""Magnus (Magus): The god of sorcery, Magnus withdrew from the creation of the world at the last second, though it cost him dearly. What is left of him on the world is felt and controlled by mortals as magic. One story says that, while the idea was thought up by Lorkhan, it was Magnus who created the schematics and diagrams needed to construct the mortal plane. He is sometimes represented by an astrolabe, a telescope, or, more commonly, a staff. Cyrodilic legends say he can inhabit the bodies of powerful magicians and lend them his power. Associated with Zurin Arctus, the Underking.""},{""text1"":""Malacath (God of Curses): Malacath is the reanimated dung that was Trinimac. A somewhat weak but vengeful Daedra, the Dark Elves say he is also Malak, the god-king of the orcs. He always tests the Dunmer for physical weakness.""},{""text1"":""Malooc (Horde King): An enemy god of the Ra Gada. Led the goblins against the Redguards during the first era. Fled east when the army of the HoonDing overtook his goblin hordes.""},{""text1"":""Mauloch (Malacath): An Orcish god, Mauloch troubled the heirs of King Harald for a long time. Fled east after his defeat at the Battle of Dragon Wall, ca. 1E660. His rage was said to fill the sky with his sulphurous hatred, later called the \""Year of Winter in Summer\"".""},{""text1"":""Mara (Goddess of Love): Nearly universal goddess. Origins started in mythic times as a fertility goddess. In Skyrim, Mara is a handmaiden of Kyne. In the Empire, she is Mother-Goddess. She is sometimes associated with Nir of the 'Anuad', the female principle of the cosmos that gave birth to creation. Depending on the religion, she is either married to Akatosh or Lorkhan, or the concubine of both.""},{""text1"":""Mehrunes Dagon (God of Destruction): Popular Daedric power. He is associated with natural dangers like fire, earthquakes, and floods. In some cultures, though, Dagon is merely a god of bloodshed and betrayal. He is an especially important deity in Morrowind, where he represents its near-inhospitable terrain.""},{""text1"":""Mephala (Androgyne): Mephala is the Webspinner, or the Spider God. In Morrowind, he/she was the ancestor that taught the Chimer the skills they would need to evade their enemies or to kill them with secret murder. Enemies were numerous in those days since the Chimer were a small faction. He/she, along with Boethiah, organized the clan systems that eventually became the basis for the Great Houses. He/she founded the Morag Tong. Also called the Anticipation of Vivec.""},{""text1"":""Molag Bal (God of Schemes, King of Rape): Daedric power of much importance in Morrowind. There, he is always the archenemy of Boethiah, the Prince of Plots. He is the main source of the obstacles to the Dunmer (and preceding Chimer) people. In the legends, Molag Bal always tries to upset the bloodlines of Houses or otherwise ruin Dunmeri 'purity'. A race of supermonsters, said to live in Molag Amur, are the result of his seduction of Vivec during the previous era.""},{""text1"":""Morihaus (First Breath of Man): Ancient cultural hero god of the Cyro-Nordics. Legend portrays him as the Taker of the Citadel, an act of mythic times that established Human control over the Valley Heartland. He is often associated with the Nordic powers of thu'um, and therefore with Kynareth.""},{""text1"":""Morwha (Teat God): Yokudan fertility goddess. Fundamental deity in the Yokudan pantheon, and the favorite of Tall Papa's wives. Still worshipped in various areas of Hammerfell, including Stros M'kai. Morwha is always portrayed as four-armed, so that she can 'grab more husbands'.""},{""text1"":""Nerevar (Godkiller): The Chimeri king of Resdayn, the Golden Age of old Veloth. Slain during the Battle of Red Mountain, Nerevar was the Herald of the Triune Way, and is the foremost of the saints of Dunmeri faith. He is said to have killed Dumac, the Last Dwarven King, and feasted on his heart.""},{""text1"":""Onsi (Boneshaver): Notable warrior god of the Yokudan Ra Gada, Onsi taught Mankind how to pull their knives into swords.""},{""text1"":""Orkey (Old Knocker): A loan-god of the Nords, who seem to have taken up his worship during Aldmeri rule of Atmora. Nords believe they once lived as long as Elves until Orkey appeared; through heathen trickery, he fooled them into a bargain that 'bound them to the count of winters'. At one time, legends say, Nords only had a lifespan of six years due to Orkey's foul magic. Shor showed up, though, and, through unknown means, removed the curse, throwing most of it onto the nearby Orcs.""},{""text1"":""Phynaster: Hero-god of the Summerset Isles, who taught the Altmer how to naturally live another hundred years by using a shorter walking stride.""},{""text1"":""Rajhin (Footpad): Thief god of the Khajiiti, who grew up in the Black Kiergo section of Senchal. The most famous burglar in Elsweyr's history, Rajhin is said to have stolen a tattoo from the neck of Empress Kintyra as she slept.""},{""text1"":""Reman (The Cyrodiil): Culture god-hero of the Second Empire, Reman was the greatest hero of the Akaviri Trouble. Indeed, he convinced the invaders to help him build his own empire, and conquered all of Tamriel except for Morrowind. He instituted the rites of becoming Emperor, which included the ritual geas to the Amulet of Kings, a soulgem of immense power. His Dynasty was ended by the Dunmeri Morag Tong at the end of the first era. Also called the Worldly God.""},{""text1"":""Riddle'Thar (Two-Moons Dance): The cosmic order deity of the Khajiiti, the Riddle'Thar was revealed to Elsweyr by the prophet Rid-Thar-ri'Datta, the Mane. The Riddle'Thar is more a set of guidelines by which to live than a single entity, but some of his avatars like to appear as humble messengers of the gods. Also known as the Sugar God.""},{""text1"":""Ruptga (Tall Papa): Chief deity of the Yokudan pantheon. Ruptga, more commonly 'Tall Papa', was the first god to figure out how to survive the Hunger of Satakal. Following his lead, the other gods learned the 'Walkabout', or a process by which they can persist beyond one lifetime. Tall Papa set the stars in the sky to show lesser spirits how to do this, too. When there were too many spirits to keep track of, though, Ruptga created a helper out the dead skin of past worlds. This helper is Sep (see below), who later creates the world of mortals.""},{""text1"":""Satakal (The Worldskin): Yokudan god of everything. A fusion of the concepts of Anu and Padomay. Basically, Satakal is much like the Nordic Alduin, who destroys one world to begin the next. In Yokudan mythology, Satakal had done (and still does) this many times over, a cycle which prompted the birth of spirits that could survive the transition. These spirits ultimately become the Yokudan pantheon. Popular god of the Alik'r nomads.""},{""text1"":""Sheogorath (The Mad God): The fearful obeisance of Sheogorath is widespread, and is found in most Tamrielic quarters. Contemporary sources indicate that his roots are in Aldmeri creation stories; therein, he is 'born' when Lorkhan's divine spark is removed. One crucial myth calls him the 'Sithis-shaped hole' of the world.""},{""text1"":""Sheor (Bad Man): In Bretony, the Bad Man is the source of all strife. He seems to have started as the god of crop failure, but most modern theologians agree that he is a demonized version of the Nordic Shor, born during the dark years after the fall of Saarthal.""},{""text1"":""Sep (The Snake): Yokudan version of Lorkhan. Sep is born when Tall Papa creates someone to help him regulate the spirit trade. Sep, though, is driven crazy by the hunger of Satakal, and he convinces some of the gods to help him make an easier alternative to the Walkabout. This, of course, is the world as we know it, and the spirits who followed Sep become trapped here, to live out their lives as mortals. Sep is punished by Tall Papa for his transgressions, but his hunger lives on as a void in the stars, a 'non-space' that tries to upset mortal entry into the Far Shores.""},{""text1"":""Shezarr (God of Man): Cyrodilic version of Lorkhan, whose importance suffers when Akatosh comes to the fore of Imperial (really, Alessian) religion. Shezarr was the spirit behind all human undertaking, especially against Aldmeri aggression. He is sometimes associated with the founding of the first Cyrodilic battlemages. In the present age of racial tolerance, Shezarr is all but forgotten.""},{""text1"":""Shor (God of the Underworld): Nordic version of Lorkhan, who takes sides with Men after the creation of the world. Foreign gods (i.e., Elven ones) conspire against him and bring about his defeat, dooming him to the underworld. Atmoran myths depict him as a bloodthirsty warrior king who leads the Nords to victory over their Aldmeri oppressors time and again. Before his doom, Shor was the chief of the gods. Sometimes also called Children's God (see Orkey, above).""},{""text1"":""Sotha Sil (Mystery of Morrowind): God of the Dunmer, Sotha Sil is the least known of the divine Tribunal. He is said to be reshaping the world from his hidden, clockwork city.""},{""text1"":""Stendarr (God of Mercy): God of the Nine Divines, Stendarr has evolved from his Nordic origins into a deity of compassion or, sometimes, righteous rule. He is said to have accompanied Tiber Septim in his later years. In early Altmeri legends, Stendarr is the apologist of Men.""},{""text1"":""Stuhn (God of Ransom): Nordic precursor to Stendarr, brother of Tsun. Shield-thane of Shor, Stuhn was a warrior god that fought against the Aldmeri pantheon. He showed Men how to take, and the benefits of taking, prisoners of war.""},{""text1"":""Syrabane (Warlock's God): An Aldmeri god-ancestor of magic, Syrabane aided Bendu Olo in the Fall of the Sload. Through judicious use of his magical ring, Syrabane saved many from the scourge of the Thrassian Plague. He is also called the Apprentices' God, for he is a favorite of the younger members of the Mages Guild.""},{""text1"":""Tava (Bird God): Yokudan spirit of the air. Tava is most famous for leading the Yokudans to the isle of Herne after the destruction of their homeland. She has since become assimilated into the mythology of Kynareth. She is still very popular in Hammerfell among sailors, and her shrines can be found in most port cities.""},{""text1"":""Tiber Septim (Talos, the Dragonborn): Heir to the Seat of Sundered Kings, Tiber Septim is the most important hero-god of Mankind. He conquered all of Tamriel and ushered in the Third Era (and the Third Empire). Also called Ysmir, 'Dragon of the North'.""},{""text1"":""Trinimac: Strong god of the early Aldmer, in some places more popular than Auri-El. He was a warrior spirit of the original Elven tribes that led armies against the Men. Boethiah is said to have assumed his shape (in some stories, he even eats Trinimac) so that he could convince a throng of Aldmer to listen to him, which led to their eventual Chimeri conversion. He vanishes from the mythic stage after this, to return as the dread Malacath (Altmeri propaganda portrays this as the dangers of Dunmeri influence).""},{""text1"":""Tsun: Extinct Nordic god of trials against adversity. Died defending Shor from foreign gods.""},{""text1"":""Tu'whacca (Tricky God): Yokudan god of souls. Tu'whacca, before the creation of the world, was the god of Nobody Really Cares. When Tall Papa undertook the creation of the Walkabout, Tu'whacca found a purpose; he became the caretaker of the Far Shores, and continues to help Redguards find their way into the afterlife. His cult is sometimes associated with Arkay in the more cosmopolitan regions of Hammerfell.""},{""text1"":""Vivec (Master of Morrowind): Warrior-poet god of the Dunmer. Vivec is the invisible keeper of the holy land, ever vigilant against the dark gods of the Volcano. He/she has saved the Dunmeri people from certain death on numerous occasions, most notably when he/she taught them how to breathe water for a day so that he/she could flood Morrowind and kill the Akaviri invaders, ca. 2E572.""},{""text1"":""Xarxes: Xarxes is the god of ancestry and secret knowledge.

While Auri-El Time Dragon might be the king of the gods, the Bosmer revere Y'ffre as the spirit of 'the now'. According to the Wood Elves, after the creation of the mortal plane everything was in chaos. The first mortals were turning into plants and animals and back again. Then Y'ffre transformed himself into the first of the Ehlnofey, or 'Earth Bones'. After these laws of nature were established, mortals had a semblance of safety in the new world, because they could finally understand it. Y'ffre is sometimes called the Storyteller, for the lessons he taught the first Bosmer. Some Bosmer still possess the knowledge of the chaos times, which they can use to great effect (the Wild Hunt).""},{""text1"":""Ysmir (Dragon of the North): The Nordic aspect of Talos. He withstood the power of the Greybeards' voices long enough to hear their prophecy. Later, many Nords could not look on him without seeing a dragon.""},{""text1"":""Z'en (God of Toil): Bosmeri god of payment in kind. Studies indicate origins in both Argonian and Akaviri mythologies, perhaps introduced into Valenwood by Kothringi sailors. Ostensibly an agriculture deity, Z'en sometimes proves to be an entity of a much higher cosmic order. His worship died out shortly after the Knhaten Flu.""},{""text1"":""Zeht (God of Farms): Yokudan god of agriculture.

Dissident Priests ask whether Dagoth Ur's powers and the  Tribunal powers might ultimately derive from the same source -- Red  Mountain. Sources in the Apographa suggest that the Tribunal relied on  profanely enchanted tools to achieve godhead, and that those unholy  devices were the ones originally created by the ungodly Dwemer sorceror  Kagrenac to create the False Construct Numidium.""},{""text1"":""The Dissident Priests say that the Temple has always maintained a public  face [represented by the Heirographa -- the \""priestly writings\""] and a  hidden face [represented by the Apographa -- the \""hidden writings\""]. The  public account portrays the actions of the Tribunal in a heroic light,  while the hidden writings reveal secrets, untruths, inconsistencies,  conflicting accounts and varying interpretations which hint at darker  and less heroic motives and actions of the Tribunes. In particular,  conflicting accounts of the battle at Red Mountain raise questions about  the Tribunal's conduct, and about the source of their subsequent  apotheosis. Also, there is good evidence that the Tribunal have been  concealing the true nature of the threat posed by Dagoth Ur at Red  Mountain, misleading the people about the Tribunal's ability to protect  Morrowind from Dagoth Ur, and concealing a recent dramatic diminishing  of the Tribunal's magical powers.""},{""text1"":""Ashlander tradition does not place the Tribunal at Red Mountain, and  holds that the Dwemer destroyed themselves, rather than that Nerevar  destroyed them. Ashlander tradition further holds that Nerevar left  Dagoth Ur guarding the profane secrets of Red Mountain while Nerevar  went to confer with the Grand Council [i.e., the Tribunal], that Nerevar  died at the conference [not of his wounds, according to the Ashlanders,  but from treachery], and that subsequently the Tribunal confronted a  defiant Dagoth Ur within Red Mountain, then drove Dagoth Ur beneath Red  Mountain when he would not yield to their will.""},{""text1"":""While challenging the divinity of the Tribunal, the Dissidents do not  challenge the sainthood or heroism of the Tribunal. In fact, the  Dissident Priests advocate restoring many of the elements of  Fundamentalist Ancestor Worship as practiced by the Ashlanders and by  Saint Veloth. Exactly how this would work is debated inconclusively  within the Dissident Priests.""},{""text1"":""Though no consensus exists among the Dissidents about whether the  Nerevarine prophecies are genuine, all agree that the persecution of the  Nerevarines is unjust and politically motivated. The Dissident Priests  do not reject mysticism, revelation, or prophecy as part of the  religious experience. The Dissidents have not resolved the issue of true  or false insights. They have studied the mysticism of the Ashlander  Ancestor Cults, in particular the rites of the Ashlander seers and wise  women, and the prophecies of the Incarnate. Many among the Dissident  Priests have come to believe that the Nerevarine prophecies are genuine,  and have made a systematic study of prophecies recorded in Temple  archives.""},{""text1"":""The Dissident Priests reject the authority of the Archcanon and the  Ordinators.

Generally the offspring bear the racial traits of the mother, though some traces of the father's race may also be present. It is less clear whether the Argonians and Khajiit are interfertile with both humans and elves. Though there have been many reports throughout the Eras of children from these unions, as well as stories of unions with daedra, there have been no well documented offspring. Khajiit differ from humans and elves not only their skeletal and dermal physiology -- the \""fur\"" that covers their bodies -- but their metabolism and digestion as well. Argonians, like the dreugh, appear to be a semi-aquatic troglophile form of humans, though it is by no means clear whether the Argonians should be classified with dreugh, men, mer, or (in this author's opinion), certain tree-dwelling lizards in Black Marsh.""},{""text1"":""The reproductive biology of orcs is at present not well understood, and the same is true of goblins, trolls, harpies, dreugh, tsaesci, imga, various daedra and many others. Certainly, there have been cases of intercourse between these \""races,\"" generally in the nature of rape or magickal seduction, but there have been no documented cases of pregnancy. Still the interfertility of these creatures and the civilized hominids has yet to be empirically established or refuted, likely due to the deep cultural differences. Surely any normal Bosmer or Breton impregnated by an orc would keep that shame to herself, and there's no reason to suppose that an orc maiden impregnated by a human would not be likewise ostracized by her society. Regrettably, our oaths as healers keep us from forcing a coupling to satisfy our scientific knowledge. We do know, however, that the sload of Thras are hermaphrodites in their youth and later reabsorb their reproductive organs once they are old enough to move about on land. It can be safely assumed that they are not interfertile with men or mer.""},{""text1"":""One might further wonder whether the proper classification of these same \""races,\"" to use the imprecise but useful term, should be made from the assumption of a common heritage and the differences between them have arisen from magickal experimentation, the manipulations of the so-called \""Earth Bones,\"" or from gradual changes from one generation to the next. ""}]"

A central belief in the active participation of Deities in mundane matters can be challenged by the reference to apparent apathy and indifference on the part of Gods during times of plague or famine.""},{""text1"":""\tFrom intervention in legendary quests to manifestations in common daily life, no pattern for the Gods of Tamriel activities is readily perceived. The concerns of Gods in many ways may seem unrelated or at best unconcerned with the daily trials of the mortal realm. The exceptions do exist, however.""},{""text1"":""\tMany historical records and legends point to the direct intervention of one or more gods at times of great need. Many heroic tales recount blessings of the divinity bestowed upon heroic figures who worked or quested for the good of a Deity or the Deity's temple. Some of the more powerful artifacts in the known world were originally bestowed upon their owners through such reward. It has also been reported that priests of high ranking in their temples may on occasion call upon their Deity for blessings or help in time of need. The exact nature of such contact and the blessings bestowed is given to much speculation, as the temples hold such associations secret and holy. This direct contact gives weight to the belief that the Gods are aware of the mortal realm. In many circumstances, however, these same Gods will do nothing in the face of suffering and death, seeming to feel no need to interfere. It is thus possible to conclude that we, as mortals, may not be capable of understanding more than a small fraction of the reasoning and logic such beings use.""},{""text1"":""\tOne defining characteristic of all Gods and Goddesses is their interest in worship and deeds. Deeds in the form of holy quests are just one of the many things that bring the attention of a Deity. Deeds in everyday life, by conforming to the statutes and obligations of individual temples are commonly supposed to please a Deity. Performance of ceremony in a temple may also bring a Deity's attention. Ceremonies vary according to the individual Deity. The results are not always apparent but sacrifice and offerings are usually required to have any hope of gaining a Deity's attention.""},{""text1"":""\tWhile direct intervention in daily temple life has been recorded, the exact nature of the presence of a God in daily mundane life is a subject of controversy. A traditional saying of the Wood Elves is that \""One man's miracle is another man's accident.\"" While some gods are believed to take an active part of daily life, others are well known for their lack of interest in temporal affairs.""},{""text1"":""\tIt has been theorized that gods do in fact gain strength from such things as worship through praise, sacrifice and deed. It may even be theorized that the number of worshippers a given Deity has may reflect on His overall position among the other Gods. This my own conjecture, garnered from the apparent ability of the larger temples to attain blessings and assistance from their God with greater ease than smaller religious institutions.""},{""text1"":""\tThere are reports of the existence of spirits in our world that have the same capacity to use the actions and deeds of mortals to strengthen themselves as do the Gods. The understanding of the exact nature of such creatures would allow us to understand with more clarity the connection between a Deity and the Deity's worshipers.""},{""text1"":""\tThe implication of the existence of such spirits leads to the speculation that these spirits may even be capable of raising themselves to the level of a God or Goddess. Motusuo of the Imperial Seminary has suggested that these spirits may be the remains of Gods and Goddesses who through time lost all or most of their following, reverting to their earliest most basic form. Practioners of the Old Ways say that there are no Gods, just greater and lesser spirits. Perhaps it is possible for all three theories to be true.""}]"

The original letter to the mysterious Dhaunayne was copied and began circulating around the Ashlands of Vvardenfell a few months ago.

While the reader may conclude after reading this letter that the Prince would be furious about such a work, impugning his highness with great malevolence, quite the reverse was true. The Prince and his mother, Queen Barenziah, had it privately printed into bound copies and sent to libraries and booksellers throughout Morrowind.""},{""text1"":""As matter of record, the Prince and the Queen have not officially stated whether the letter is a work of pure imagination or based on an actual occurrence.

I hope I have served you well in my capacity as informant in the court of Prince Helseth, a man who I have stated in many previous reports could teach Molag Bal how to scheme. As you know, I've spent nearly a year now working my way into his inner circle of advisors. He was in need of friendship when he first arrived in Morrowind and eagerly took to me and a few others.  Still, he was disinclined to trust any of us, which is perhaps not surprising, given his tenuous position in Morrowind society.""},{""text1"":""For your unholiness's recollection, the Prince is the eldest son of Barenziah, who was once the Queen of Morrowind and once the Queen of the High Rock kingdom of Wayrest. At the death of her husband, Prince Helseth's stepfather, King Eadwyre, there was a power struggle between the Prince and Eadwyre's daughter, the Princess Elysana. Though details of what transpired are imperfect, it is clear that Elysana won the battle and became Queen, banishing Helseth and Barenziah. Barenziah's only other child, Morgiah, had already left court to marry and become Queen of the Summurset Isle kingdom of Firsthold.""},{""text1"":""Barenziah and Helseth crossed the continent to return to Morrowind only last year.  They were well received by Barenziah's uncle, our current king, Hlaalu Athyn Llethan, who had taken the throne after Barenziah's abdication more than forty years ago. Barenziah made it clear that she had no designs on reclaiming the throne, but merely to retire to her family estates. Helseth, as you know, has lingered in the royal court, and many have whispered that while he lost the throne of Wayrest, he does not intend to lose the throne of Morrowind at Llethan's death.""},{""text1"":""I've kept your unholiness informed of the Prince's movements, meetings, and plots, as well as the names and characters of his other advisors. As you may recall, I've often thought that I was not the only spy in Helseth's court. I told you before that a particular Dunmer counselor of Helseth looked like a fellow I had seen in the company of Tholer Saryoni, the Archcanon of the Tribunal Temple. Another, a young Nord woman, has been verified to visit the Imperial fortress in Balmora. Of course, in their cases, they might well have been on Helseth's own business, but I couldn't be certain. I had begun to think myself paranoid as the Prince himself when I found myself doubting the sincere loyalty of the Prince's chamberlain, Burgess, a Breton who had been in his employ since his days in the court of Wayrest.""},{""text1"":""That is the background on that night, last night.""},{""text1"":""Yesterday morning, I received a curt invitation to dine with the Prince. Based only on my own paranoia, I dispatched one of my servants, who is a good and loyal servant of the House Dres, to watch the palace and report back anything unusual. Just before dinner, he returned and told me what he had witnessed.""},{""text1"":""A man cloaked in rags had been given entrance into the palace, and had stayed there for some time. When he left, my servant saw his face beneath the cloak -- an alchemist of infamous repute, said to be a leading suppliers of exotic poisons. A fine observer, my servant also noticed that the alchemist entered the palace smelling of wickwheat, bittergreen, and something alien and sweet. When he left, he was odorless.""},{""text1"":""He had come to the same conclusion as I did. The Prince had procured ingredients to prepare a poison. Bittergreen alone is deadly when eaten raw, but the other ingredients suggested something far deeper. As your unholiness can doubtless imagine, I went to dinner that night, prepared for any eventuality.""},{""text1"":""All of Prince Helseth's other counselors were in attendance, and I noticed that all were slightly apprehensive. Of course, I imagined that I was in a nest of spies, and all knew of the Prince's mysterious meeting. It is just as likely that some knew of the alchemist's visit, while others were simply concerned by the nature of the Prince's invitation, and still others merely unconsciously adopted the tense disposition of their fellow, better informed counselors.""},{""text1"":""The Prince, however, was in fine mettle and soon had everyone relaxed and at ease. At nine, we were all ushered into his dining hall where the feast had been laid out. And what a feast!  Honeyed gorapples, fragrant stews, roasts in various blood sauces, and every variety of fish and fowl expertly and ostentatiously prepared. Crystal and gold flagons of wine, flin, shein, and mazte were at our seats to be savored as appropriate with each course.

What would my ancestors say if I joined them after sitting at a table, eventually dying of poison?

Cuhlecain, the King of Falkreath in West  Cyrodiil, was in a bad situation. To make any bid at unifying the  Colovian Estates, he needed to secure his northern border, where the  Nords and Reachmen had been fighting for centuries. He allies with  Skyrim at the Battle of Old Hrol'dan. Leading his forces was Hjalti  Early-Beard. Hjalti was from the island kingdom of Alcaire, in High  Rock, and would become Tiber Septim, the First Emperor of Tamriel.""},{""text1"":""Hjalti was a shrewd tactician, and his small band of Colovian troops and  Nord berserkers broke the Reachman line, forcing them back beyond the  gates of Old Hrol'dan. A siege seemed impossible, as Hjalti could expect  no reinforcements from Falkreath. That night a storm came and visited  Hjalti's camp. It spoke with him in his tent. At dawn, Hjalti went up to  the gates, and the storm followed just above his head. Arrows could not  penetrate the winds around him. He shouted down the walls of Old  Hrol'dan, and his men poured in. After their victory, the Nords called  Hjalti Talos, or Stormcrown.""},{""text1"":""Cuhlecain, with his new invincible general, unifies West Cyrodiil in  under a year. No one can stand before Hjalti's storms. The Underking  knows that if Hjalti is to become Emperor of Tamriel, he must first  capture the Eastern Heartland. Hjalti uses them both. He needs Cuhlecain  in the Colovian Estates, where foreigners are mistrusted. It is obvious  why he needs Ysmir. They march on the East, the battlemages surrender  before their armies, and they take the Citadel. Before Cuhlecain can be  crowned, Hjalti secretly murders him and his loyalist contingent. These  assassinations are blamed on the enemies of Cuhlecain, which, for  political reasons, are still the Western Reach. Zurin Arctus, the Grand  Battlemage (not the Underking), then crowns Hjalti as Tiber Septim, new  Emperor of All Cyrodiil. After he captures the Imperil Throne, Septim  finds the initial administration of a fully united Cyrodiil a  time-consuming task. He sends the Underking to deal with Imperial  expansion into Skyrim and High Rock. Ysmir, mindful that it might seem  as if Tiber Septim is in two places at once, works behind the scenes.  This period of levelheaded statesmanship and diplomacy, this sudden  silence, heretofore unknown in the roaring tales of Talosian conquest,  are explained away later. (The assassination story is embroidered -- now  it is popularly Talos' own throat that was cut.)""},{""text1"":""The human kingdoms are conquered, even Hammerfell, whose capture was  figured to be an arduous task. The Underking wants a complete invasion, a  chance to battle their foreign wind spirits himself, but Tiber Septim  refutes him. He has already made a better plan, one that will seem to  legitimize his rule. Cyrodiil supports the losing side of a civil war  and are invited in. Finally, the Empire can turn its eyes onto the  Elves.""},{""text1"":""The Underking continues to press on Tiber Septim the need to conquer  Morrowind. The Emperor is not sure that it is a wise idea. He has heard  of the Tribunal's power. The Underking wants his vengeance, and reminds  Tiber Septim that he is fated to conquer the Elves, even the Tribunal.  Arctus advises against the move but Septim covets the Ebony in  Morrowind, as he sorely needs a source of capital to rebuild Cyrodiil  after 400 years of war. The Underking tells him that, with the Tribunal  dead, Septim might steal the Tribunal's power and use it against the  High Elves (certainly the oldest enemies of Lorkhan, predating even the  Tribunal). Summerset Isle is the farthest thing from Tiber Septim's  mind. Even then, he was planning to send Zurin Arctus to the King of  Alinor to make peace. The Ebony need wins out in the end. The Empire  invades Morrowind, and the Tribunal give up. When certain conditions of  the Armistice include not only a policy of noninterference with the  Tribunal, but also, in the Underking's eyes, a validation of their  religious beliefs, Ysmir is furious. He abandons the Empire completely.  This was the betrayal the Greybeards spoke of. Or so he thinks.""},{""text1"":""Without the Underking's power, all ideas of conquering Tamriel vanish.

Tiber Septim, always fascinated  by the Dwarves, has Zurin Arctus research this grand artifact. In doing  so, Arctus stumbles upon some of the stories of the war at Red Mountain.

He thinks it is the  heart of Lorkhan's body that is needed to power the Numidium.""},{""text1"":""While Zurin Arctus is raving about his discovery, the prophecy finally  becomes clear to Tiber Septim. This Numidium is what he needs to conquer  the world. It is his destiny to have it. He contacts the Underking and  says he was right all along. They should kill the Tribunal, and they  need to get together and make a plan. While the Underking was away he  realized the true danger of Dagoth-Ur. Something must to be done. But he  needs an army, and his old one is available again. The trap is set.""},{""text1"":""The Underking arrives and is ambushed by Imperial guards. As he takes  them on, Zurin Arctus uses a soulgem on him. With his last breath, the  Underking's Heart roars a hole through the Battlemage's chest. In the  end, everyone is dead, the Underking has reverted back to ash, and Tiber  Septim strolls in to take the soulgem. When the Elder Council arrives,  he tells them about the second attempt on his life, this time by his  trusted battle mage, Zurin Arctus, who was attempting a coup. He has the  dead guards celebrated as heroes, even the one who was blasted to  ash... He warns Cyrodiil about the dangers within, but says he has a  solution to the dangers without.

Still, there are conflicting reports of what  really happened, and this is why there is such confusion over such  questions as: Why does Alcaire claim to be the birthplace of Talos,  while other sources say he came from Atmora? Why does Tiber Septim seem  to be a different person after his first roaring conquests? Why does  Tiber Septim betray his battlemage? Is the Mantella the heart of the  battlemage or is it the heart of Tiber Septim?""},{""text1"":""Tiber Septim is succeeded by his grandson, Pelagius I. Pelagius is just  not of the same caliber.

Even after she convinced them that she would be the  best regent to rule the Empire while her husband Pelagius sought  treatment for his madness, there was still conflict. In particular from  the Duke of Vengheto, Thane Minglumire, who took a particular delight in  exposing all of the Empress's lack of practical knowledge.""},{""text1"":""In this particular instance, Katariah and the Council were discussing  the unrest in Black Marsh, the massacre of Imperial troops outside the  village of Armanias. The sodden swampland and the sweltering climate,  particular in summertide, would endanger the troops if they wore their  usual armor.""},{""text1"":""\""I know a very clever armorer,\"" said Katariah, \""His name is Hazadir, an  Argonian who knows the environments our army will be facing. He knew him  in Vivec where he was a slave to the master armorer there, before he  moved to the Imperial City as a freedman. We should have him design  armor and weaponry for the campaign.\""""},{""text1"":""Minglumire gave a short, barking laugh: \""She wants a slave to design the  armor and weaponry for our troops! Sirollus Saccus is the finest  armorer in the Imperial City. Everyone knows that.\""""},{""text1"":""After much debate, it was finally decided to have both armorers contend  for the commission. The Council also elected two champions of equal  power and prowess, Nandor Beraid and Raphalas Eul, to battle using the  arms and armaments of the real competitors in the struggle. Whichever  champion won, the armorer who supplied him would earn the Imperial  commission. It was decided that Beraid would be outfitted by Hazadir,  and Eul by Saccus.""},{""text1"":""The fight was scheduled to commence in seven days.""},{""text1"":""Sirollus Saccus began work immediately. He would have preferred more  time, but he recognized the nature of the test. The situation in  Armanias was urgent. The Empire had to select their armorer quickly, and  once selected, the preferred armorer had to act swiftly and produce the  finest armor and weaponry for the Imperial army in Black Marsh. It  wasn't just the best armorer they were looking for. It was the most  efficient.""},{""text1"":""Saccus had only begun steaming the half-inch strips of black virgin oak  to bend into bands for the flanges of the armor joints when there was a  knock at his door. His assistant Phandius ushered in the visitor. It was  a tall reptilian of common markings, a dull, green-fringed hood, bright  black eyes, and a dull brown cloak. It was Hazadir, Katariah's  preferred armorer.""},{""text1"":""\""I wanted to wish you the best of luck on the -- is that ebony?\""""},{""text1"":""It was indeed. Saccus had bought the finest quality ebony weave  available in the Imperial City as soon as he heard of the competition  and had begun the process of smelting it. Normally it was a six month  procedure refining the ore, but he hoped that a massive convection oven  stoked by white flames born of magicka would shorten the operation to  three days. Saccus proudly pointed out the other advancements in his  armory. The acidic lime pools to sharpen the blade of the dai-katana to  an unimaginable degree of sharpness. The Akaviri forge and tongs he  would use to fold the ebony back and forth upon itself. Hazadir laughed.""},{""text1"":""\""Have you been to my armory? It's two tiny smoke-filled rooms. The front  is a shop. The back is filled with broken armor, some hammers, and a  forge. That's it. That's your competition for the millions of gold  pieces in Imperial commission.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I'm sure the Empress has some reason to trust you to outfit her  troops,\"" said Sirollus Saccus, kindly. He had, after all, seen the shop  and knew that what Hazadir said was true. It was a pathetic workshop in  the slums, fit only for the lowliest of adventurers to get their iron  daggers and cuirasses repaired. Saccus had decided to make the best  quality regardless of the inferiority of his rival. It was his way and  how he became the best armorer in the Imperial City.""},{""text1"":""Out of kindness, and more than a bit of pride, Saccus showed Hazadir  how, by contrast, things should be done in a real professional armory.  The Argonian acted as an apprentice to Saccus, helping him refine the  ebony ore, and to pound it and fold it when it cooled. Over the next  several days, they worked together to create a beautiful dai-katana with  an edge honed to a keen sharp enough to trim a mosquito's eyebrows, and  a suit of armor of bound wood, leather, silver, and ebony to resist the  winds of Oblivion.""},{""text1"":""On the day of the battle, Saccus, Hazadir, and Phandius finished  polishing the armor and brought in Raphalas Eul for the fitting. Hazadir  left only then, realizing that Nandor Beraid would be at his shop  shortly to be outfitted.""},{""text1"":""The two warriors met in the arena in the Imperial City with an audience  of the Empress and the Imperial Council two hours later. From the moment  Saccus saw Eul in his suit of shining ebony and dai-katana blazing and  Beraid in his collection of dusty, rusted merchandise from Hazadir's  shop, he knew who would win. And he was right.""},{""text1"":""The first blow from the dai-katana lodged in the soft shield, as there  was no metal trim to deflect it. Before Eul could pull his sword back,  Beraid lashed out with his long sword at the weak points in the armor,  it was the perfect weapon to perforate the joints. Eul retrieved his  sword and slashed at Beraid but his armor was scaled and angled, and the  attacks rolled off like water. When Eul's armor began to fall off, the  Empress and Council, out of mercy, called a victor.""},{""text1"":""Hazadir received the commission and thanks to his knowledge of Argonian  battle tactics and weaponry and how best to combat them, he designed  implements of war that brought down the insurrection in Armanias.  Katariah won the respect of Council, and even, grudgingly, that of Thane  Minglumire. Sirollus Saccus went to Morrowind to learn what Hazadir  learned there, and was never heard from again.""}]"

The masters teach students of all ages from all parts of the Empire the most ancient techniques and the most modern variations, and many a former pupil has graduated to great fame. I myself trained there, and as a young child I remember asking my first master, Zoaraym, which former student he felt had best learned the lessons of the Temple.""},{""text1"":""\""I was not a teacher when I met this man, but a student myself,\"" he said, smiling in reminiscence, his great wrinkled face becoming even more like the withered fruit of the bathrum tree. \""This was long ago, before your parents were born. For many years I had trained at the Temple, rising to study in more difficult and demanding classes taught by the wisest and most learned Masters of the Two-Moons Dance.""},{""text1"":""\""Gi'Nanth, you will come to understand that the tempering of your body must attend the tempering of your mind, and there is a prescribed order of training we at the Temple have designed over the years in concordance with the way of Riddle'Thar. I had reached the highest level, where my power and skill were such that even by supernatural, magical means, few could ever could ever best me in weaponless combat.""},{""text1"":""\""There was a servant at the Temple at the time, a Dunmer a few years older than myself and those in my class. We had never noticed him but in passing over the years, for he would enter the training chambers quietly, clean for a few minutes' time, and leave without saying a word. Not that we would have listened if he spoke, so enraptured were we in our exercises and lessons.""},{""text1"":""\""When our last Master told some of us, myself included, that the time had come for us to leave the Temple or become teachers, there was a great festival of celebration. The Mane itself deigned to visit and observe our ceremony. As we were and are a Temple of philosophy and combat, there were contests of debate and competitions in the Temple's war arena, not only among the elite few, but open to all students.""},{""text1"":""\""On the first day of the festival, I was examining the gladiatorial roster to see who I would fight with first, when I heard a conversation behind me: the servants speaking to the archpriest of the Temple. It was the first time I heard the Dunmer's voice, and the first time I heard his name.""},{""text1"":""\""'I understand you wish to rejoin your people's struggle in Morrowind, Taren,' the archpriest was saying. 'I am sorry to hear it. You have been an institution here for many, many years, and you will be missed. If there's anything I can do for you, please name it.'""},{""text1"":""\""'Thank you for your kindness,' the Dunmer replied. 'I do have a request, but I fear you would be loath to grant it. Ever since I first came to the Temple, I have been watching the students learn, and practiced myself when my duties allowed for it. I know I am but a servant here, but I would be honored if you would allow me to compete in the war arena.'""},{""text1"":""\""I stifled back my gasp at the mer's impertinence, to even suggest that he would be worthy to fight with those of us who had trained so hard. To my surprise, the archpriest agreed, adding the name Taren Omathan to the roster at the beginners' level. I was eager to whisper the news to my fellow elite students, but my first bout was scheduled to begin in a few minutes' time.""},{""text1"":""\""I fought eighteen competitions in a row, besting all. The crowd gathered in the arena knew of my prowess, and gave polite, unsurprised applause at the end of each fight. As much as I focused on my own battles, I could not help noticing that other competitions were receiving more and more attention in the arena. The spectators whispered among themselves, and more began drifting away to see something that was evidently more spectacular and unusual than my unbroken string of victories.""},{""text1"":""\""One of the most important lessons we teach from the Two-Moons Dance is the lesson of rejecting one's vanity. I understood then the importance of achieving a personal synchronicity with one's body and mind, of rebuffing outside influences of no importance, but I admit I had not accepted the lesson in my heart. I knew I was good, but my pride was hurt.""},{""text1"":""\""It came down to a contest of champions, and I was one of the two. When I saw who the other fighter would be, my mood turned from one of wounded dignity to complete disbelief. My adversary was the servant, Taren.""},{""text1"":""\""It must be a joke, or some final philosophical test, I reasoned. Then I looked into the crowd, and saw anticipation of a great battle to come in every eye. We gave one another the sign of respect, I stiffly and he with great elegance and modesty. The fight began.""},{""text1"":""\""Initially, I sought to end it quickly, still thinking that he was unworthy to be cleaning the arena, let alone fighting in it. In retrospect, I was being illogical, as I must have known he had bested as many students as I to had reach that final level. He offered simple counterblows to my attacks, and responded in kind. His style was expansive, encompassing sophisticated arcane foot play one moment and simple jabs and kicks the next. I tried assailments intended to dazzle, but his face never showed either fear or contempt of my abilities.""},{""text1"":""\""The fight lasted for a long time. I don't recall when I realized I was destined to lose, but when it ended, I was not surprised with the outcome. With a sense of unusual and true modesty, I bowed to him. But I could not resist asking him as we left the arena to the sound of thunderous applause how he had so secretly grown to become a Master.""},{""text1"":""\""'I never had a choice to rise in the Temple,' Taren replied. 'Every day, I cleaned the training chambers of the elite classes and then the beginners'. So you see, I never had the misfortune to forget those early mistakes, lessons, and techniques while observing and learning the ways of the Masters.'""},{""text1"":""\""He left Torval early the next morning to return to his homeland, and I never saw him again, though I've heard people saw that he's become a priest and a teacher. I became a teacher as well, for children just beginning their training in the Two-Moons, as well as the elite. And I make certain to bring my best pupils to see the how the unlearned fight, so that they might never forget.\""""}]"

Truth owes its medicinal nature to the establishment of the myth of justice. Its curative properties it likewise owes to the concept of sacrifice. Princes, chiefs, and angels all subscribe to the same notion. This is a view primarily based on a prolific abolition of an implied profanity, seen in ceremonies, knife fighting, hunting, and the exploration of the poetic. On the ritual of occasions, which comes to us from the days of the cave glow, I can say nothing more than to loosen your equation of moods to lunar currency. Later, and by that I mean much, much later, my reign will be seen as an act of the highest love, which is a return from the astral destiny and the marriages between. By that I mean the catastrophes, which will come from all five corners. Subsequent are the revisions, differentiated between hope and the distraught, situations that are only required by the periodic death of the immutable. Cosmic time is repeated: I wrote of this in an earlier life. An imitation of submersion is love's premonition, its folly into the underworld, by which I mean the day you will read about outside of yourself in an age of gold. For on that day, which is a shadow of the sacrificial concept, all history is obliged to see me for what you are: in love with evil. To keep one's powers intact at such a stage is to allow for the existence of what can only be called a continual spirit. Make of your love a defense against the horizon. Pure existence is only granted to the holy, which comes in a myriad of forms, half of them frightening and the other half divided into equal parts purposeless and assured. Late is the lover that comes to this by any other walking way than the fifth, which is the number of the limit of this world. The lover is the highest country and a series of beliefs. He is the sacred city bereft of a double. The uncultivated land of monsters is the rule. This is clearly attested by ANU and his double, which love knows never really happened. Similarly, all the other symbols of absolute reality are ancient ideas ready for their graves, or at least the essence of such. This scripture is directly ordered by the codes of Mephala, the origin of sex and murder, defeated only by those who take up those ideas without my intervention. The religious elite is not a tendency or a correlation. They are dogma complemented by the influence of the untrustworthy sea and the governance of the stars, dominated at the center by the sword, which is nothing without a victim to cleave unto. This is the love of God and he would show you more: predatory but at the same time instrumental to the will of critical harvest, a scenario by which one becomes as he is, of male and female, the magic hermaphrodite. Mark the norms of violence and it barely registers, suspended as it is by treaties written between the original spirits. This should be seen as an opportunity, and in no way tedious, though some will give up for it is easier to kiss the lover than become one.

Truth owes its medicinal nature to the establishment of the myth of justice. Its curative properties it likewise owes to the concept of sacrifice. Princes, chiefs, and angels all subscribe to the same notion. This is a view primarily based on a prolific abolition of an implied profanity, seen in ceremonies, knife fighting, hunting, and the exploration of the poetic. On the ritual of occasions, which comes to us from the days of the cave glow, I can say nothing more than to loosen your equation of moods to lunar currency. Later, and by that I mean much, much later, my reign will be seen as an act of the highest love, which is a return from the astral destiny and the marriages between. By that I mean the catastrophes, which will come from all five corners. Subsequent are the revisions, differentiated between hope and the distraught, situations that are only required by the periodic death of the immutable. Cosmic time is repeated: I wrote of this in an earlier life. An imitation of submersion is love's premonition, its folly into the underworld, by which I mean the day you will read about outside of yourself in an age of gold. For on that day, which is a shadow of the sacrificial concept, all history is obliged to see me for what you are: in love with evil. To keep one's powers intact at such a stage is to allow for the existence of what can only be called a continual spirit. Make of your love a defense against the horizon. Pure existence is only granted to the holy, which comes in a myriad of forms, half of them frightening and the other half divided into equal parts purposeless and assured. Late is the lover that comes to this by any other walking way than the fifth, which is the number of the limit of this world. The lover is the highest country and a series of beliefs. He is the sacred city bereft of a double. The uncultivated land of monsters is the rule. This is clearly attested by ANU and his double, which love knows never really happened. Similarly, all the other symbols of absolute reality are ancient ideas ready for their graves, or at least the essence of such. This scripture is directly ordered by the codes of Mephala, the origin of sex and murder, defeated only by those who take up those ideas without my intervention. The religious elite is not a tendency or a correlation. They are dogma complemented by the influence of the untrustworthy sea and the governance of the stars, dominated at the center by the sword, which is nothing without a victim to cleave unto. This is the love of God and he would show you more: predatory but at the same time instrumental to the will of critical harvest, a scenario by which one becomes as he is, of male and female, the magic hermaphrodite. Mark the norms of violence and it barely registers, suspended as it is by treaties written between the original spirits. This should be seen as an opportunity, and in no way tedious, though some will give up for it is easier to kiss the lover than become one. The lower regions crawl with these souls, caves of shallow treasures, meeting in places to testify by way of extension, when love is only satisfied by a considerable (incalculable) effort.'""},{""text1"":""The ending of the words is ALMSIVI.""},{""text1"":""For these were the days of Resdaynia, when Chimer and Dwemer lived under the wise and benevolent rule of the AMLSIVI and their champion the Hortator, though the Dwemer had become foolish and challenged their masters.""},{""text1"":""Out of their fortresses they came with golden ballistae that walked and mighty atronachs and things that spat flame and things that made killing songs.

I felt the longing of this life which slowly began to ease  the agony in my heart. As I was gradually nursed back to health,  knowledge of record and history tried desperately to fill the yawning,  nauseous chasm of my soul. I began to know the deadpan search for  freedom and forgetfulness, and I released the hold on my life. Though it  still lurched, pained, in front of me, I just stared back with tired,  vacant eyes as if watching the most fascinating of nothing. My mind  drifted, only to be slammed back reluctantly, repeatedly, and painfully  by those I vaguely remember knowing, as if from a different life and  age. I try, in vain, to forgive and forget myself as I paste on those  plaster smiles and strain to look levelly. I remember. I forget. I  forget again. I remember less. I am saddened at the thought that I have  forgotten. I am not who I used to be. Though it pained me so, I was  never so real as those lonely, lost times of my undoing. I am torn  asunder at the thought of losing forever that, which has changed my life  eternally, and that which I fear in the depths of my soul will never be  again. That, which has gifted me with more pain than I have ever known  in all of my lives or all of the lives that I know through my own.""},{""text1"":""Who am I to ask this of you?""}]"

This was  more than an ideological shift or political statement; the Chimer  _physically_ changed as well. Details of this transformation can be  found elsewhere, but each of the three demons represented a crucial part  of its metaphysics.

When word reached the Bosmer that trees were being felled (allegedly a crime in the strange Bosmeri religion), a unit of archers were dispatched from larger conflicts in the south. The Bosmer were thus goaded into splitting their forces into smaller groups.""},{""text1"":""The Bosmer archers took up positions in the remaining trees whose branches were now twenty or more feet apart, allowing some light into the forest floor. The Bosmer bent the remaining trees with their magics into small fortifications from which to fire their bows.""},{""text1"":""When the tree-cutters arrived the next morning, a half dozen Khajiit fell to the Bosmer arrows in the first volley. After that the Khajiit took large wooden shields from the backs of the Senche-raht and made a crude shelter. The Khajiit, even the enormous Senche-raht, were able to hide between this shelter and one of the larger trees. When it became apparent that the Khajiit would not leave their shelter, some Bosmer chose to descend and engage the Khajiit sword-to-claw.""},{""text1"":""When the Bosmer were nearly upon the shelter, one of the Khajiit began playing on a native instrument of plucked metal bars.

Although outnumbered, they were attacking from behind by surprise and won the ground quickly.""},{""text1"":""The Bosmer archers in the trees would have still won the battle were they not having troubles of their own. A group of Dagi and Dagi-raht, two of the less common forms of Khajiit who live in the trees of the Tenmar forest, jumped from one tree to another under a magical cover of silence. They took up positions in the higher branches that could not hold a Bosmer's weight. When the signal came, they used their claws and either torches or spells of fire (accounts from the two survivors I spoke with vary on this point) to distract the archers while the battle on the ground took place. A few of the archers were able to flee, but most were killed.""},{""text1"":""Apparently the Dagi and Dagi-raht have more magical ability than is widely believed if they were able to keep themselves magically silenced for so long. One of the surviving Bosmer told me that he saw a few ordinary cats among the Dagi and even claimed that these ordinary cats are known as 'Alfiq' and that they were the spellcasters, but Bosmer are almost as unreliable as the Khajiit when it comes to the truth, and I cannot believe that a housecat can cast spells.""},{""text1"":""At the end of the day the Khajiit lost perhaps a half-dozen fighters out a force of no more than four dozen, while the Bosmer lost nearly an entire company of archers.

His attention was on the pirates on a small island off the coast called Calluis Lar. They had been more brazen as late, attacking royal barges in organized raids. To deliver a crushing blow, he ordered the greatest part of his militia to invade the island -- an incursion he himself would lead.""},{""text1"":""A few days after Reman left the capitol, the revolt of the Trebbite Monks exploded. The attacks were well-coordinated and without warning. The Chief of the Guards did not wait to be announced, bursting into Morgiah's bedchamber ahead of a flurry of maidservants.""},{""text1"":""\""My Queen,\"" he said. \""It is a revolution.\""""},{""text1"":""By contrast, Gialene was not asleep when Kael came to deliver the news. She was seated by the window, smoking her hookah and looking at the fires far off in the hills.""},{""text1"":""\""Morgiah is with council,\"" he explained. \""I am certain they are telling her that the Trebbite Monks are behind the uprising, and that the revolution will be at the city gates by morning.\""""},{""text1"":""\""How large is the revolutionary army in contrast to the remaining royal militia?\"" asked Gialene.""},{""text1"":""\""The odds are well in our favor,\"" said Kael. \""Though not perhaps as much as we hoped. The country folk, it seems, like to complain about their queen, but stop short of insurrection. Primarily, the army is composed of the Monks themselves and a horde of mercenaries your father's gold bought. In a way of thinking, it is preferable this way -- they are more professional and organized that a common mob. Really, they are a true army, complete with a horn section.\""""},{""text1"":""\""If that doesn't frighten the Black Queen into abdication, nothing will,\"" smiled Gialene, rising from her chair. \""The poor dear must be beside herself with worry. I must fly to her side and enjoy it.\""""},{""text1"":""Gialene was disappointed when she saw Morgiah come out of the Council Chambers. Considering that she had been woken from a deep sleep with cries of revolution and had spent the last several hours in consultation with her meager general force, she looked beautiful. There was a sparkle of proud defiance in her bright red eyes.""},{""text1"":""\""My Queen,\"" Gialene cried, forcing real tears. \""I came as soon as I heard! Will we all be slaughtered?\""""},{""text1"":""\""A distinct possibility,\"" replied Morgiah simply. Gialene tried to read her, but the expressions of women, especially alien women, were a far greater challenge than those of Altmer men.""},{""text1"":""\""I hate myself for even thinking to propose this,\"" said Gialene. \""But since the cause of their fury is you, perhaps if you were to give up the throne, they might disperse.

But an unruly mob is unlikely to have mages skilled in the arts of Restoration, by which they could shield themselves from the spells, or Mysticism, by which they could reflect the spells back on my battlemages. That would be the worst scenario, but even if they were well-organized enough to have Mystics in their ranks -- and enough of them to reflect so many spells -- it just isn't done. No battlefield commander would advise such a defense during a siege unless he knew precisely what he was going to be meeting.

It went against every tradition, and as a Trebbite Monk, he valued tradition above every other virtue. There was little other choice, though, given the intelligence. He had few enough healers in the army as it were, and their energies could not be wasted casting resistance spells.""},{""text1"":""At dawn's light, the rebel army was in sight of the gleaming spires of Firsthold. Friar Lylim gathered together every soldier who knew even the rudimentary secrets of Mysticism, who knew how to tap in to the elementary conundrums and knots of the energies of magicka. Though few were masters of the art, their combined force was powerful to behold. A great surge of entangling power washed over the army, crackling, hissing, and infusing all with their ghostly force. When they arrived at the gates, every soldier, even the least imaginative, knew that no spell would touch him for a long time.""},{""text1"":""Friar Lylim watched his army batter into the gate with the great satisfaction of a commander who has counteracted an unthinkable attack with an outrageous defense. The smile quickly faded from his face.""},{""text1"":""They were met at the battlements not by mages but by common archers of the palace guard. As the flaming arrows fell upon the siegers like a red rain, the healers ran in to help the wounded. Their healing spells reflected off the dying men, one after the other. Chaos ruled as the attackers suddenly found themselves defenseless and began a panicked, unorganized retreat. Friar Lylim himself considered briefly holding his ground before fleeing himself.""},{""text1"":""Later, he would send furious notes to Lady Gialene and Kael, but they were returned. Even his best secret agents within the palace were unable to find their whereabouts.""},{""text1"":""Neither had, as it turns out, much previous experience with torture, and they soon confessed their treachery to the King's satisfaction. Kael was executed, and Gialene was sent back with escort to her father's court of Skywatch. He has still to find a husband for her. Reman, by contrast, has elected not to take a new royal concubine. The common folk of Firsthold consider this break in palace protocol to be more of the sinister alien influence of the Black Queen, and grumble to all who will listen.""},{""text1"":"" ""}]"

Elf we called him, for Elf he was, yet unlike any other of his kind we had ever seen before that day. His spear and armor bore the radiant and terrible glow of unknown magicka, and so adorned this unknown rider seemed more wight than warrior. ""},{""text1"":""What troubled, nay, frightened us most at that moment was the call that rose from the Elven ranks. It was not fear, not wonder, but an unabashed and unbridled joy, the kind of felicity felt by a damned man who has been granted a second chance at life.  For at that time the Elves were as damned and near death as ever they had been during the great skirmishes of Solstheim. The Battle of the Moesring was to be the final stand between Nord and Elf on our fair island. Led by Ysgramor, we had driven the Elven scourge from Skyrim, and were intent on cleansing Solstheim of their kind as well.  Our warriors, armed with the finest axes and swords Nord craftsmen could forge, cut great swaths through the enemy ranks. The slopes of the Moesring ran red with Elf blood. Why, then, would our foe rejoice? Could one rider bring such hope to an army so hopeless? ""},{""text1"":""To most of our kind, the meaning of the call was clear, but the words were but a litany of Elven chants and cries. There were some among us, however, the scholars and chroniclers, who knew well the words and shuddered at their significance.  ""},{""text1"":""\""The Snow Prince is come! Doom is at hand!\"" ""},{""text1"":""There was then a great calm that overcame the Elves that still stood. Through their mass the Snow Prince did ride, and as a longboat slices the icy waters of the Fjalding he parted the ranks of his kin. The magnificent white horse slowed to a gallop, then a trot, and the unknown Elf rider moved to the front of the line at a slow, almost ghostlike pace. ""},{""text1"":""A Nord warrior sees much in a life of bloodshed and battle, and is rarely surprised by anything armed combat may bring. But few among us that day could have imagined the awe and uncertainty of a raging battlefield that all at once went motionless and silent. Such is the effect the Snow Prince had on us all. For when the joyous cries of the Elves had ended, there remained a quiet known only in the solitude of slumber. It was then our combined host, Elf and Nord alike, were joined in a terrible understanding -- victory or defeat mattered little that day on the slopes of the Moesring Mountains. The one truth we all shared was that death would come to many that day, victor and vanquished alike. The glorious Snow Prince, an Elf unlike any other, did come that day to bring death to our kind. And death he so brought. ""},{""text1"":""Like a sudden, violent snow squall that rends travelers blind and threatens to tear loose the very foundations of the sturdiest hall, the Snow Prince did sweep into our numbers. Indeed the ice and snow did begin to swirl and churn about the Elf, as if called upon to serve his bidding. The spinning of that gleaming spear whistled a dirge to all those who would stand in the way of the Snow Prince, and our mightiest fell before him that day. Ulfgi Anvil-Hand, Strom the White, Freida Oaken-Wand, Heimdall the Frenzied. All lay dead at the foot of the Moesring Mountains. ""},{""text1"":""For the first time that day it seemed the tide of battle had actually turned. The Elves, spurred on by the deeds of the Snow Prince, rallied together for one last charge against our ranks. It was then, in a single instant, that the Battle of the Moesring came to a sudden and unexpected end.  ""},{""text1"":""Finna, daughter of Jofrior, a lass of only twelve years and squire to her mother, watched as the Snow Prince cut down her only parent. In her rage and sorrow, Finna picked up Jofrior's sword and threw it savagely at her mother's killer. When the Elf's gleaming spear stopped its deadly dance, the battlefield fell silent, and all eyes turned to the Snow Prince. No one that day was more surprised than the Elf himself at the sight that greeted them all. For upon his great steed the Snow Prince still sat, the sword of Jofrior buried deeply in his breast. And then, he fell, from his horse, from the battle, from life. The Snow Prince lay dead, slain by a child. ""},{""text1"":""With their savior defeated, the spirit of the remaining Elven warriors soon shattered.  Many fled, and those that remained on the battlefield were soon cut down by our broad Nord axes. When the day was done, all that remained was the carnage of the battlefield. And from that battlefield came a dim reminder of valor and skill, for the brilliant armor and spear of the Snow Prince still shined. Even in death, this mighty and unknown Elf filled us with awe. ""},{""text1"":""It is common practice to burn the corpses of our fallen foes. This is as much a necessity as it is custom, for death brings with it disease and dread. Our chieftains wished to cleanse Solstheim of the Elven horde, in death as well as life. It was decided, however, that such was not to be the fate of the Snow Prince. One so mighty in war yet so loved by his kin deserved better. Even in death, even if an enemy of our people. ""},{""text1"":""And so we brought the body of the Snow Prince, wrapped in fine silks, to a freshly dug barrow. The gleaming armor and spear were presented on a pedestal of honor, and the tomb was arrayed with treasures worthy of royalty. All of the mighty chieftains agreed with this course, that the Elf should be so honored. His body would be preserved in the barrow for as long as the earth chose, but would not be offered the protection of our Stalhrim, which was reserved for Nord dead alone.

The upheavals of the reign of Uriel VII were only the outward signs of the historical forces that would eventually lead to the fall of the Septim Dynasty. The so called \""Dragon Break\"" was first proposed at this time, by a wide variety of cults and fringe sects across the Empire, connected only by a common obsession with the events surrounding Tiber Septim's rise to power -- the \""founding myth,\"" if you will, of the Septim Dynasty.""},{""text1"":""The basis of the Dragon Break doctrine is now known to be a rather prosaic error in the timeline printed in the otherwise authoritative \""Encyclopedia Tamrielica,\"" first published in 3E 12, during the early years of Tiber Septim's reign.

The Alessians had systematically burned all the libraries they could find, and their own records were largely destroyed during the War of Righteousness.""},{""text1"":""The author of the Encyclopedia Tamrielica was apparently unfamiliar with the Alessian \""year,\"" which their priesthood used to record all dates. We now know this refers to the length of the long vision-trances undertaken by the High Priestess, which might last anywhere from a few weeks to several months. Based on analysis of the surviving trance scrolls, as well as murals and friezes from Alessian temples, I estimate that the Alessian Order actually lasted only about 150 years, rather than the famous \""one thousand and eight years\"" given by the Encyclopedia Tamrielica. The \""mystery\"" of the millennial-plus rule of the Alessians was accepted but unexplained until the spread of the Lorkhan cults in the late 3rd era, when the doctrine of the Dragon Break took hold. Because this dating (and explanation) was so widely held at the time, and then repeated by historians down through today, it has come to have the force of tradition. Recall, however, that the 3rd era historians were already separated from the Alessians by a gulf of more than 2,000 years. And history was still in its infancy, relying on the few archives from those early days.""},{""text1"":""Today, modern archaeology and paleonumerology have confirmed what my own research in Alessian dating first suggested: that the Dragon Break was invented in the late 3rd era, based on a scholarly error, fueled by obsession with eschatology and Numidiumism, and perpetuated by scholarly inertia.""},{""text1"":"" ""}]"

As you can see, after a rather tedious crossing, I've at long last made my way from Bhoriane to my favorite principality in High Rock, surprisingly literate and always fascinating Kambria.

Zenithar, the God of Work and Commerce, is the most revered deity in Kambria, which served my (that is to say our) purposes well, as the people are naturally receptive to bribery.  Still, it did me little good. I could find nothing specific about our quarry.  After days of inquiry, an old crone recommended that I go to a nearby village called Grimtry Garden, and find the cemetery caretaker there.  I set off at once.""},{""text"":""I know you are impatient when it comes to details, and have little taste for Breton architecture, but if you ever find yourself in mid-High Rock, you owe it to yourself to visit this quaint village.

He bade me leave, that the land was haunted and if I chose to stay I would be in the greatest danger.  I told him that I would not go until he told me what he knew about Hadwaf Neithwyr and his patron Baliasir.

I sidestepped when it tried to rush me, but closed the distance to keep it from escaping into the night.  For hours we fought, I always on the defense, it always trying to free itself, or slay me, or both.  I have no doubt that a werewolf has greater energy reserves than a man, but it is a beast and does not know how to save and temper its movements.  As the dawn rose, we were both nearly unconscious from fatigue, but I received my reward.

I know that you will appreciate that at least.""},{""text"":""It started when I came to Wayrest, and through my friend Lady Moorling and her court connections was introduced to Baliasir himself. I had to proceed carefully, not wanting him to know of our designs on Azura's Star which I presumed he possessed, given to him by his servant Hadwaf Neithwyr. His function in Queen Elysana's court seemed to be decorative, like so many of her courtiers, and it was not hard to differentiate myself from the others when we began conversing on the school of mysticism. Many of the other hangers-on at the palace can speak eloquently on the subject of the magickal arts, but it seemed that only he and I had deep knowledge of the craft.""},{""text"":""Many a nobleman or adventurer who aren't mages by profession learn a spell or two from the useful schools of restoration or destruction. I told Baliasir quite truthfully that I had never learned any of that (oh, but I wish I knew some healing spells of the school of restoration now), but that I had developed some small skill in mysticism. Not enough to be a Psijic, of course, but in telekinesis, password, and spell reflection I had some amateur ability. He responded with compliments, which allowed me to segue into the topic of another spell of mysticism, the soul trap.""},{""text"":""I told him I was unlearned but curious about that spell.

The only thing I could think of was how I would get the Star when he showed it to me. I still knew so little about Baliasir, his past and his power, but the opportunity was too great to let pass. Still, I must admit that I held hopes that you would arrive, as you threatened you might in your letter, so I might have someone of physical strength to aid me in my adventure.""},{""text"":""I am growing weaker and weaker as I write this, so I must proceed with the basic facts. I went to the crypt the following night, and Baliasir led me through the maze of it to the repository where he kept the Star. We were talking quite casually, and as you've so often said, it seemed an excellent time for an ambush. I grabbed the Star and unsheathed my blade in what I felt was amazing speed.""},{""text"":""He turned to me and I suddenly felt that I was moving like a snail. In a flash, Baliasir changed his form and became his true self, not man or mer, but daedra. A colossal daedra lord who swiped back the Star from my grasp and laughed at my sword as it thudded against his impenetrable hide.""},{""text"":""I knew I had been beaten, and I threw myself towards the corridor. A blue flash of energy coursed through me, flung by Baliasir's claws. At once, I began to feel death. He could have smote me with a thousand spells, but he chose the one where I could lie down, and suffer, and hear him laugh. At the very least, I did not give him that pleasure.""},{""text"":""Already struck, it was too late for me to cast a counterspell of mysticism, one to dispel the magicka, reflect it or absorb it as my own. But I did still know how to teleport myself, what mystics term 'Recall,' to whatever place I'd last set a spiritual anchor. I confess that at the time, I didn't remember where that would be. Perhaps in Bhoriane when I arrived in the Iliac Bay, or in Kambria, or in Grimtry Garden where I met the caretaker, or my hostess's palace in Wayrest. I prayed that I had not set the anchor last when I was with you in Morrowind, for it said that if the distance is too great, one can be caught between dimensions. Still, I was willing to take that chance, rather than being the plaything of Baliasir.""},{""text"":""I cast the spell and found myself back on the doorstep of Lady Moorling's palace. To be out of the crypt and away from the daedra was a relief, but I had so hoped that I had been smart enough to cast an anchor near a Mages Guild or a temple where I could find a healer. Instead, knowing I was too weak to walk far, I beat on the door and was taken here, where I write this letter, lying in my bed.""},{""text"":""As I wrote those words, dear Elysbetta, Lady Moorling, came in, quite tearfully and frantic, to tell me the healers should be hre withn but a few minute.

Perhaps you've already wandered the estate and seen some of its delights before coming to this chamber: the seven fountains of marble and porphyry, the reflecting pool, the various groves, the colonnades and quincunx.  I don't think you would have already gone to the second floor suites and the west wing as you would have had to pass this room first, and picked up this letter.  But believe me, they're beautifully appointed with magnificent balustrades, winding staircases, intimate salons, and bedchambers worthy of your affluence.""},{""text"":""The price of this property is exorbitant, certainly, but for a man like you who seeks only the best, this is the villa you must have.

My dilemma that caused my inexcusable absence began shortly after I arrived here early to make certain the villa was well-cleaned for your inspection.  A man named Koniinge crept up behind me, and gripped me by the throat.  Clamping his left hand over my mouth and nose, and throttling me with his right hand, crushing the soft spot on my throat just below the thyroidal cartilage, he effectively strangled me in a few quick but very painful minutes.""},{""text"":""I am currently buried in a pile of leaves in the north statuary parterre, close to the exceptional sculptural representation of the Transformation of Trinimac.

No.  Much better to keep reading, and see where this is going.""},{""text"":""Koniinge, it seems, was in a partnership with his friend Charwich to try to recover Azura's Star.  They understood it to be in the possession of someone named Hadwaf Neithwyr, a man who conjured up the Daedra Prince Azura herself to acquire it.  As Neithwyr originally haled from High Rock, Charwich went there to look for him, while his partner searched Morrowind.  They planned to communicate their findings by letters sent through couriers.""},{""text"":""Charwich's first letter stated that he had found information that Neithwyr had a mysterious patron named Baliasir, a fact he had learned at a cemetery with a gravestone of Neithwyr's sister Peryra and a lycanthropic caretaker.  Koniinge replied back that he could find nothing about Baliasir, but believed that Neithwyr had returned to High Rock with Peryra after getting the Star.  Charwich's last letter was a written on his deathbed, having sustained mortal wounds from his battle with Baliasir, who it seemed had been a mighty daedra lord.""},{""text"":""Koniinge grieved for his friend, and traveled the span of the Empire to Wayrest, to pay his call of condolences on Lady Moorling, the woman at whose house Charwich had been staying.  After making some inquiries, Koniinge learned that her ladyship had left the city, quite suddenly.  She had been entertaining a guest named Charwich, and it was understood that he had died, though no one ever saw the body.  Certainly no healers had been sent to her house on the 13th of Last Seed of last year.  And no one in Wayrest, just like no one in Tel Aruhn, had ever heard of Baliasir.""},{""text"":""Poor Koniinge was suddenly unsure of everything.  He retraced his late partner's path through Boriane and Grimtry Gardens, but found that the Neithwyr family crypt was elsewhere, in a small town in the barony of Dwynnen.  There was indeed a lycanthropic caretaker, fortunately in human form at the time.  When questioned (using the technique of strangulation, release, strangulation, release), he told Koniinge the story that he had told Charwich many months before.""},{""text"":""Hadwaf and Peryra Neithwyr had returned to Dwynnen, intent on settling old business.  As the Star requires potent spirits for power, they thought they would begin small by capturing the spirit of the werewolf they knew of in the family graveyard.  Sadly, for them, their grasp exceeded their reach.  When the poor caretaker resumed his human form one morning, he found himself lying next to the shredded, bloody bodies of the Neithwyr siblings.  Distressed and fearful, he brought the corpses and all their possessions down into the crypt.   They were still there when Charwich came, and so too was Azura's Star.""},{""text"":""Koniinge now saw things clearly.  The letters he had received from Charwich were lies, intended to keep him away.  Undoubtedly with the assistance of Lady Moorling, his new partner, he had concocted stories, including one of his own demise, to trick Koniinge into abandoning the quest for the Star.  It was clearly a sad statement on the nature of friendship, and one that needed immediate correction.""},{""text"":""It took the better part of six months for Koniinge to find his old partner.  Charwich and Lady Moorling had used the power of the Star to make themselves very wealthy and powerful.  They assumed a number of different identities in their travels through High Rock and Skyrim, and then down to Valenwood and the Summurset Isle.  Along the way, of course, the Star itself disappeared, as great daedric artifacts always do.  The couple still had much wealth, but their love sadly fell on troubled times.  When they reached Alinor, they parted ways.""},{""text"":""One must assume that during their months together, Charwich must have told Lady Moorling about Koniinge.  It's pleasant to think of the loving couple laughing over the stories they were telling him about the mythical and dangerous Baliasir.  Charwich must not have given his former beloved a very accurate physical description, however, because when Lady Moorling (then under the identity of the Countess Zyliana) met Koniinge, she had no idea who he was.  It came as quite a surprise to her when he began strangling her and requesting information about her former paramour.""},{""text"":""Before she died, she told Koniinge what Charwich's new name and title was, and where he was looking for a new palace.  She even told him about me.  Given all the twists and bends the last months' chase took him on, it was not difficult to find which palace Charwich was looking to buy, and what time his appointment was to view it.

I gave the courier some extra gold, so if he doesn't find you, he is to make inquiries to your whereabouts.  As you can see, after a rather tedious crossing, I've at long last made my way from Bhoriane to my favorite principality in High Rock, surprisingly literate and always fascinating Kambria.  I at once ensconced myself in one of the better libraries here, becoming reacquainted with the locals and the lore.  At the risk of being overly optimistic, I think I might have struck on something very interesting about this mysterious fellow, Hadwaf Neithwyr.""},{""text1"":""Many here in town remember him, though few very fondly.  When Hadwaf Neithwyr left, so too did a great plague.  No one thinks it a coincidence.""},{""text1"":""According to my contacts here, Azura is not his only master.  It may be that when he summoned forth the Daedra and accepted her Star, he was doing so for someone named Baliasir.  Apparently, Neithwyr worked for this Baliasir in some capacity, but I never could find out from anyone exactly what Baliasir's line of business was, nor what Neithwyr did for him.  Zenithar, the God of Work and Commerce, is the most revered deity in Kambria, which served my (that is to say our) purposes well, as the people are naturally receptive to bribery.  Still, it did me little good. I could find nothing specific about our quarry.  After days of inquiry, an old crone recommended that I go to a nearby village called Grimtry Garden, and find the cemetery caretaker there.  I set off at once.""},{""text1"":""I know you are impatient when it comes to details, and have little taste for Breton architecture, but if you ever find yourself in mid-High Rock, you owe it to yourself to visit this quaint village.  Like a number of other similar towns in High Rock, there is a high wall surrounded it.  As well as being picturesque, it's a remnant of the region's turbulent past and a useful barrier against the supernatural creatures that sometimes stalk the countryside.  More about that in a moment.""},{""text1"":""The cemetery is actually outside of the city gates, I discovered.  The locals warned me to wait until morning to speak to the caretaker, but I was impatient for information, and did not want to waste a moment.  I trekked through the woods to the lonely graveyard, and immediately found the shuffling, elderly man who was the caretaker.  He bade me leave, that the land was haunted and if I chose to stay I would be in the greatest danger.  I told him that I would not go until he told me what he knew about Hadwaf Neithwyr and his patron Baliasir.  On hearing their names, he fled deeper into the jumble of broken tombstones and decrepit mausoleums.  I naturally pursued.""},{""text1"":""I saw him scramble down into an enormous crypt and gave chase.  There was no light within, but I had planned enough to bring with me a torch.  The minute I lit it, I heard a long, savage howl pierce the silence, and I knew that the caretaker had left quickly not merely because he feared speaking of Neithwyr and Baliasir.  Before I saw the creature, I heard its heavy breath and the clack of its clawed feet on stone moving closer to me.  The werewolf emerged from the gloom, brown and black, with slavering jaws, looking at me with the eyes of the cemetery caretaker, now given only to animal hunger.""},{""text1"":""I instantly had three different instinctive reactions.  The first was, of course, flight.  The second was to fight.  But if I fled, I might never find the caretaker again, and learn what he knew.  If I fought, I might injure or even kill the creature and be even worse off.  So I elected to go with my third option: to hold my ground and keep the creature within its tomb until the night became morning, and the caretaker resumed his humanity.""},{""text1"":""I've sparred often enough unarmored, but surely never with so much at stake, and never with so savage an opponent.  My mind was always on danger not only of injury but the dread disease of lycanthropy. Every rake of its claw I parried, every snap of its foaming jaws I ducked.  I sidestepped when it tried to rush me, but closed the distance to keep it from escaping into the night.  For hours we fought, I always on the defense, it always trying to free itself, or slay me, or both.  I have no doubt that a werewolf has greater energy reserves than a man, but it is a beast and does not know how to save and temper its movements.  As the dawn rose, we were both nearly unconscious from fatigue, but I received my reward.

I just need to explain what happened so that you'll understand, and then all my affairs in this world will be ended. The one advantage of my condition is that I must be brief, without my habitually ornamental descriptions of people and places. I know that you will appreciate that at least.""},{""text1"":""It started when I came to Wayrest, and through my friend Lady Moorling and her court connections was introduced to Baliasir himself. I had to proceed carefully, not wanting him to know of our designs on Azura's Star which I presumed he possessed, given to him by his servant Hadwaf Neithwyr. His function in Queen Elysana's court seemed to be decorative, like so many of her courtiers, and it was not hard to differentiate myself from the others when we began conversing on the school of mysticism. Many of the other hangers-on at the palace can speak eloquently on the subject of the magickal arts, but it seemed that only he and I had deep knowledge of the craft.""},{""text1"":""Many a nobleman or adventurer who aren't mages by profession learn a spell or two from the useful schools of restoration or destruction. I told Baliasir quite truthfully that I had never learned any of that (oh, but I wish I knew some healing spells of the school of restoration now), but that I had developed some small skill in mysticism. Not enough to be a Psijic, of course, but in telekinesis, password, and spell reflection I had some amateur ability. He responded with compliments, which allowed me to segue into the topic of another spell of mysticism, the soul trap.""},{""text1"":""I told him I was unlearned but curious about that spell. And very naturally and comfortably, I was able to bring up the subject of Azura's Star, the endless well of souls.""},{""text1"":""Imagine how I had to hold back my excitement when he leaned in and whispered to me, \""If that interests you, come to Klythic's Cairn west of the city tomorrow night.\""""},{""text1"":""I couldn't sleep at all. The only thing I could think of was how I would get the Star when he showed it to me. I still knew so little about Baliasir, his past and his power, but the opportunity was too great to let pass. Still, I must admit that I held hopes that you would arrive, as you threatened you might in your letter, so I might have someone of physical strength to aid me in my adventure.""},{""text1"":""I am growing weaker and weaker as I write this, so I must proceed with the basic facts. I went to the crypt the following night, and Baliasir led me through the maze of it to the repository where he kept the Star. We were talking quite casually, and as you've so often said, it seemed an excellent time for an ambush. I grabbed the Star and unsheathed my blade in what I felt was amazing speed.""},{""text1"":""He turned to me and I suddenly felt that I was moving like a snail. In a flash, Baliasir changed his form and became his true self, not man or mer, but daedra. A colossal daedra lord who swiped back the Star from my grasp and laughed at my sword as it thudded against his impenetrable hide.""},{""text1"":""I knew I had been beaten, and I threw myself towards the corridor. A blue flash of energy coursed through me, flung by Baliasir's claws. At once, I began to feel death. He could have smote me with a thousand spells, but he chose the one where I could lie down, and suffer, and hear him laugh. At the very least, I did not give him that pleasure.""},{""text1"":""Already struck, it was too late for me to cast a counterspell of mysticism, one to dispel the magicka, reflect it or absorb it as my own. But I did still know how to teleport myself, what mystics term 'Recall,' to whatever place I'd last set a spiritual anchor. I confess that at the time, I didn't remember where that would be. Perhaps in Bhoriane when I arrived in the Iliac Bay, or in Kambria, or in Grimtry Garden where I met the caretaker, or my hostess's palace in Wayrest. I prayed that I had not set the anchor last when I was with you in Morrowind, for it said that if the distance is too great, one can be caught between dimensions. Still, I was willing to take that chance, rather than being the plaything of Baliasir.""},{""text1"":""I cast the spell and found myself back on the doorstep of Lady Moorling's palace. To be out of the crypt and away from the daedra was a relief, but I had so hoped that I had been smart enough to cast an anchor near a Mages Guild or a temple where I could find a healer. Instead, knowing I was too weak to walk far, I beat on the door and was taken here, where I write this letter, lying in my bed.""},{""text1"":""As I wrote those words, dear Elysbetta, Lady Moorling, came in, quite tearfully and frantic, to tell me the healers should be hre withn but a few minute.

Perhaps you've already wandered the estate and seen some of its delights before coming to this chamber: the seven fountains of marble and porphyry, the reflecting pool, the various groves, the colonnades and quincunx.  I don't think you would have already gone to the second floor suites and the west wing as you would have had to pass this room first, and picked up this letter.

My dilemma that caused my inexcusable absence began shortly after I arrived here early to make certain the villa was well-cleaned for your inspection.  A man named Koniinge crept up behind me, and gripped me by the throat.  Clamping his left hand over my mouth and nose, and throttling me with his right hand, crushing the soft spot on my throat just below the thyroidal cartilage, he effectively strangled me in a few quick but very painful minutes.""},{""text1"":""I am currently buried in a pile of leaves in the north statuary parterre, close to the exceptional sculptural representation of the Transformation of Trinimac.

No.  Much better to keep reading, and see where this is going.""},{""text1"":""Koniinge, it seems, was in a partnership with his friend Charwich to try to recover Azura's Star.  They understood it to be in the possession of someone named Hadwaf Neithwyr, a man who conjured up the Daedra Prince Azura herself to acquire it.  As Neithwyr originally haled from High Rock, Charwich went there to look for him, while his partner searched Morrowind.  They planned to communicate their findings by letters sent through couriers.""},{""text1"":""Charwich's first letter stated that he had found information that Neithwyr had a mysterious patron named Baliasir, a fact he had learned at a cemetery with a gravestone of Neithwyr's sister Peryra and a lycanthropic caretaker.  Koniinge replied back that he could find nothing about Baliasir, but believed that Neithwyr had returned to High Rock with Peryra after getting the Star.  Charwich's last letter was a written on his deathbed, having sustained mortal wounds from his battle with Baliasir, who it seemed had been a mighty daedra lord.""},{""text1"":""Koniinge grieved for his friend, and traveled the span of the Empire to Wayrest, to pay his call of condolences on Lady Moorling, the woman at whose house Charwich had been staying.  After making some inquiries, Koniinge learned that her ladyship had left the city, quite suddenly.  She had been entertaining a guest named Charwich, and it was understood that he had died, though no one ever saw the body.  Certainly no healers had been sent to her house on the 13th of Last Seed of last year.  And no one in Wayrest, just like no one in Tel Aruhn, had ever heard of Baliasir.""},{""text1"":""Poor Koniinge was suddenly unsure of everything.  He retraced his late partner's path through Boriane and Grimtry Gardens, but found that the Neithwyr family crypt was elsewhere, in a small town in the barony of Dwynnen.  There was indeed a lycanthropic caretaker, fortunately in human form at the time.  When questioned (using the technique of strangulation, release, strangulation, release), he told Koniinge the story that he had told Charwich many months before.""},{""text1"":""Hadwaf and Peryra Neithwyr had returned to Dwynnen, intent on settling old business.  As the Star requires potent spirits for power, they thought they would begin small by capturing the spirit of the werewolf they knew of in the family graveyard.  Sadly, for them, their grasp exceeded their reach.  When the poor caretaker resumed his human form one morning, he found himself lying next to the shredded, bloody bodies of the Neithwyr siblings.  Distressed and fearful, he brought the corpses and all their possessions down into the crypt.   They were still there when Charwich came, and so too was Azura's Star.""},{""text1"":""Koniinge now saw things clearly.  The letters he had received from Charwich were lies, intended to keep him away.  Undoubtedly with the assistance of Lady Moorling, his new partner, he had concocted stories, including one of his own demise, to trick Koniinge into abandoning the quest for the Star.  It was clearly a sad statement on the nature of friendship, and one that needed immediate correction.""},{""text1"":""It took the better part of six months for Koniinge to find his old partner.  Charwich and Lady Moorling had used the power of the Star to make themselves very wealthy and powerful.  They assumed a number of different identities in their travels through High Rock and Skyrim, and then down to Valenwood and the Summurset Isle.  Along the way, of course, the Star itself disappeared, as great daedric artifacts always do.  The couple still had much wealth, but their love sadly fell on troubled times.  When they reached Alinor, they parted ways.""},{""text1"":""One must assume that during their months together, Charwich must have told Lady Moorling about Koniinge.  It's pleasant to think of the loving couple laughing over the stories they were telling him about the mythical and dangerous Baliasir.

Just as one living in a kingdom but unaware of the political machinations underneath may see a new tax or battle preparation as the caprices of fortune, many observe floods, famines, and madness with helpless incomprehension. This is deplorable. As the great Cuilean Darnizhaan moaned, \""The power of ignorance can shatter ebony like glass.\""""},{""text1"":""What, after all, is the origin of these spiritual forces that move the invisible strings of Mundus? Any neophyte of Artaeum knows that these spirits are our ancestors -- and that, while living, they too were bewildered by the spirits of their ancestors, and so on back to the original Acharyai. The Daedra and gods to whom the common people turn are no more than the spirits of superior men and women whose power and passion granted them great influence in the afterworld.""},{""text1"":""Certainly this is our truth and our religion. But how does it help us in our sacred duty of seliffrnsae, or providing \""grave and faithful counsel\"" to lesser men?""},{""text1"":""Primarily, it is easy to grasp the necessity both of endowing good men with great power and making powerful men good. We recognize the multiple threats that a strong tyrant represents -- breeds cruelty which feeds the Daedra Boethiah and hatred which feeds the Daedra Vaernima; if he should die having performed a particularly malevolent act, he may go to rule in Oblivion; and worst of all, he inspires other villains to thirst after power and other rulers to embrace villainy. Knowing this, we have developed patience in our dealings with such despots. They should be crippled, humiliated, impoverished, imprisoned. Other counsellors may advocate assassination or warfare -- which, aside from its spiritual insignificance, is expensive and likely to inflict at least as much pain on the innocents as the brutish dictator. No, we are intelligence gatherers, dignified diplomats -- not revolutionaries.""},{""text1"":""How, then, are our counsellors \""faithful\""? We are faithful only to the Old Ways -- it is essential always to remember the spiritual world while keeping our eyes open in the physical one. Performing the Rites of Moawita on the 2nd of Hearth Fire and the Vigyld on the 1st of Second Seed are essential means of empowering salutary spirits and debilitating unclean ones. How, then, are we at once faithful to those we counsel and to the Isle of Artaeum? Perhaps the sage Taheritae said it best: \""In Mundus, conflict and disparity are what bring change, and change is the most sacred of the Eleven Forces. Change is the force without focus or origin. It is the duty of the disciplined Psijic [\""Enlightened One\""] to dilute change where it brings greed, gluttony, sloth, ignorance, prejudice, cruelty... [here Taheritae lists the rest of the 111 Prodigalities], and to encourage change where it brings excellence, beauty, happiness, and enlightenment. As such, the faithful counsel has but one master: His mind. If the man the Psijic counsels acts wickedly and brings oegnithr [\""bad change\""] and will otherwise not be counselled, it is the Psijic's duty to counterbalance the oegnithr by any means necessary [emphasis mine].\""""},{""text1"":""A student of the Old Ways may indeed ally himself to a lord -- but it is a risky relationship. It cannot be stressed enough that the choice be wisely made. Should the lord refuse wise counsel and order the Psijic (to use Taheritae's outmoded word) to perform an act contrary to the teachings of the Old Ways, there are few available options. The Psijic may obey, albeit unwillingly, and fall prey to the dark forces against which he has devoted his life. The Psijic may abandon his lord, which will bring shame on him and the Isle of Artaeum, and so may never be allowed home again. Or the Psijic may simply kill himself.""}]"

She was reared in all the luxury and security befitting a royal Dark Elven child until she reached five years of age.  At that time, His Excellency Tiber Septim I, the first Emperor of Tamriel, demanded that the decadent rulers of Morrowind yield to him and institute imperial reforms.  Trusting to their vaunted magic, the Dark Elves impudently refused until Tiber Septim's army was on the borders. An Armistice was hastily signed by the now-eager Dunmer, but not before there were several battles, one of which laid waste to Mournhold, now called Almalexia.""},{""text"":""Little Princess Barenziah and her nurse were found among the wreckage.

Count Sven and his wife reared the princess as their own daughter, seeing to it that she was educated appropriately-and more importantly, that the imperial virtues of obedience, discretion, loyalty, and piety were instilled in the child.  In short, she was made fit to take her place as a member of the new ruling class of Morrowind.""},{""text"":""The girl Barenziah grew in beauty, grace, and intelligence.  She was sweet-tempered, a joy to her adoptive parents and their five young sons, who loved her as their elder sister.  Other than her appearance, she differed from young girls of her class only in that she had a strong empathy for the woods and fields, and was wont to escape her household duties to wander there at times.""},{""text"":""Barenziah was happy and content until her sixteenth year, when a wicked orphan stable-boy, whom she had befriended out of pity, told her he had overheard a conspiracy between her guardian, Count Sven, and a Redguard visitor to sell her as a concubine in Rihad, as no Nord or Breton would marry her on account of her black skin, and no Dark Elf would have her because of her foreign upbringing.""},{""text"":""\""Whatever shall I do?\"" the poor girl said, weeping and trembling, for she had been brought up in innocence and trust, and it never occurred to her that her friend the stable-boy would lie to her.""},{""text"":""The wicked boy, who was called Straw, said that she must run away if she valued her virtue, but that he would come with her as her protector.

After a few days there, they managed to get jobs as guards for a disreputable merchant caravan.  The caravan was heading east by side roads in a mendacious attempt to elude the lawful tolls charged on the imperial highways.  Thus the pair eluded pursuit until they reached the city of Rifton, where they ceased their travels for a time.

She grew up into a beautiful and pious child, trustful of her guardian's care.  This trust, however, was exploited by a wicked orphan stable boy at Count Sven's estate, who with lies and fabrications tricked her into fleeing Darkmoor with him when she turned sixteen.  After many adventures on the road, they settled in Riften, a Skyrim city near the Morrowind borders.""},{""text"":""The stable boy, Straw, was not altogether evil.  He loved Barenziah in his own selfish fashion, and deception was the only way he could think of that would cement possession of her.

He wanted to buy a small farm and settle down into a comfortable marriage, but at the time his earnings were barely enough to feed and shelter them.""},{""text"":""After only a short time in Riften, Straw fell in with a bold, villainous Khajiit thief named Therris, who proposed that they rob the Imperial Commandant's house in the central part of the city.

She stole away from their rooms and walked the streets of Riften in desperation, torn between her loyalty to the Empire and her love for her friends.""},{""text"":""In the end, loyalty to the Empire prevailed over personal friendship, and she approached the Commandant's house, revealed her true identity, and warned him of her friends' plan.  The Commandant listened to her tale, praised her courage, and assured her that no harm would come to her.  He was none other than General Symmachus, who had been scouring the countryside in search of her since her disappearance, and had just arrived in Riften, hot in pursuit.  He took her into his custody, and informed her that, far from being sent away to be sold, she was to be reinstated as the Queen of Mournhold as soon as she turned eighteen.

After fruitless investigations and attempts at reconciliation, in despair Barenziah took her young children and travelled to the Imperial City herself to seek the ear of then Emperor Uriel Septim VII.

That evening, news came that Symmachus had fallen in battle with the revolting peasants of Mournhold, and that the kingdom had been taken over by the rebels.  Barenziah, at this point, did not know where to seek help, or from whom.""},{""text"":""The gods, that fateful night, were evidently looking out for her as if in redress of her loss.

He comforted her, pledged his friendship-and furthermore, confirmed her suspicions that the Emperor was indeed a fraud, and none other than Jagar Tharn, the Imperial Battlemage, and one of the Nightingale's many alter egos.  Tharn had supposedly retired into seclusion from public work and installed his assistant, Ria Silmane, in his stead.  The hapless assistant was later put to death under mysterious circumstances-supposedly a plot implicating her had been uncovered, and she had been summarily executed.  However, her ghost had appeared to Eadwyre in a dream and revealed to him that the true Emperor had been kidnapped by Tharn and imprisoned in an alternate dimension.  Tharn had then used the Staff of Chaos to kill her when she attempted to warn the Elder Council of his nefarious plot.""},{""text"":""Together, Eadwyre and Barenziah plotted to gain the false Emperor's confidence.  Meanwhile, another friend of Ria's, known only as the Champion, who apparently possessed great, albeit then untapped, potential, was incarcerated at the Imperial Dungeons.

They fled to Wayrest, his ancestral kingdom in the province of High Rock, where they managed to fend off the sporadic efforts of Tharn's henchmen to haul them back to the Imperial City, or at the very least obtain revenge.  Tharn, whatever else might be said of him, was no one's fool-save perhaps Barenziah's -- and he concentrated most of his efforts toward tracking down and destroying the Champion.""},{""text"":""As all now know, the courageous, indefatigable, and forever nameless Champion was successful in reuniting the eight sundered pieces of the Staff of Chaos.

After a few days there, they managed to get jobs as guards for a disreputable merchant caravan.  The caravan was heading east by side roads in a mendacious attempt to elude the lawful tolls charged on the imperial highways.

Thanks largely to the benevolence of the Emperor, the child Barenziah was not destroyed with her parents, but reared by Count Sven of Darkmoor, a loyal Imperial trustee.  She grew up into a beautiful and pious child, trustful of her guardian's care.  This trust, however, was exploited by a wicked orphan stable boy at Count Sven's estate, who with lies and fabrications tricked her into fleeing Darkmoor with him when she turned sixteen.  After many adventures on the road, they settled in Riften, a Skyrim city near the Morrowind borders.""},{""text1"":""The stable boy, Straw, was not altogether evil.  He loved Barenziah in his own selfish fashion, and deception was the only way he could think of that would cement possession of her.  She, of course, felt only friendship toward him, but he was hopeful that she would gradually change her mind.  He wanted to buy a small farm and settle down into a comfortable marriage, but at the time his earnings were barely enough to feed and shelter them.""},{""text1"":""After only a short time in Riften, Straw fell in with a bold, villainous Khajiit thief named Therris, who proposed that they rob the Imperial Commandant's house in the central part of the city.  Therris said that he had a client, a traitor to the Empire, who would pay well for any information they could gather there.  Barenziah happened to overhear this plan and was appalled.  She stole away from their rooms and walked the streets of Riften in desperation, torn between her loyalty to the Empire and her love for her friends.""},{""text1"":""In the end, loyalty to the Empire prevailed over personal friendship, and she approached the Commandant's house, revealed her true identity, and warned him of her friends' plan.  The Commandant listened to her tale, praised her courage, and assured her that no harm would come to her.  He was none other than General Symmachus, who had been scouring the countryside in search of her since her disappearance, and had just arrived in Riften, hot in pursuit.  He took her into his custody, and informed her that, far from being sent away to be sold, she was to be reinstated as the Queen of Mournhold as soon as she turned eighteen.  Until that time, she was to live with the Septim family in the newly built Imperial City, where she would learn something of government and be presented at the Imperial Court.""},{""text1"":""At the Imperial City, Barenziah befriended the Emperor Tiber Septim during the middle years of his reign.  Tiber's children, particularly his eldest son and heir Pelagius, came to love her as a sister.  The ballads of the day praised her beauty, chastity, wit, and learning.  On her eighteenth birthday, the entire Imperial City turned out to watch her farewell procession preliminary to her return to her native land.  Sorrowful as they were at her departure, all knew that she was ready for her glorious destiny as sovereign of the kingdom of Mournhold.""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""Biography of Barenziah\nVolume Three""},{""text1"":""\nby \nStern Gamboge\nImperial Scribe""},{""text1"":""\nIn the second volume of this series, it was told how Barenziah was kindly welcomed to the newly constructed Imperial City by the Emperor Tiber Septim and his family, who treated her like a long-lost daughter during her almost one-year stay.  After several happy months there learning her duties as vassal queen under the Empire, the Imperial General Symmachus escorted her to Mournhold where she took up her duties as Queen of her people under his wise guidance.  Gradually they came to love one another and were married and crowned in a splendid ceremony at which the Emperor himself officiated.""},{""text1"":""After several hundred years of marriage, a son, Helseth, was born to the royal couple amid celebration and joyous prayer.  Although it was not publicly known at the time, it was shortly before this blessed event that the Staff of Chaos had been stolen from its hiding place deep in the Mournhold mines by a clever, enigmatic bard known only as the Nightingale.""},{""text1"":""Eight years after Helseth's birth, Barenziah bore a daughter, Morgiah, named after Symmachus' mother, and the royal couple's joy seemed complete.  Alas, shortly after that, relations with the Empire mysteriously deteriorated, leading to much civil unrest in Mournhold.  After fruitless investigations and attempts at reconciliation, in despair Barenziah took her young children and travelled to the Imperial City herself to seek the ear of then Emperor Uriel Septim VII.  Symmachus remained in Mournhold to deal with the grumbling peasants and annoyed nobility, and do what he could to stave off an impending insurrection.""},{""text1"":""During her audience with the Emperor, Barenziah, through her magical arts, came to realize to her horror and dismay that the so-called Emperor was an impostor, none other than the bard Nightingale who had stolen the Staff of Chaos.  Exercising great self-control she concealed this realization from him.  That evening, news came that Symmachus had fallen in battle with the revolting peasants of Mournhold, and that the kingdom had been taken over by the rebels.  Barenziah, at this point, did not know where to seek help, or from whom.""},{""text1"":""The gods, that fateful night, were evidently looking out for her as if in redress of her loss.  King Eadwyre of High Rock, an old friend of Uriel Septim and Symmachus, came by on a social call.  He comforted her, pledged his friendship-and furthermore, confirmed her suspicions that the Emperor was indeed a fraud, and none other than Jagar Tharn, the Imperial Battlemage, and one of the Nightingale's many alter egos.  Tharn had supposedly retired into seclusion from public work and installed his assistant, Ria Silmane, in his stead.  The hapless assistant was later put to death under mysterious circumstances-supposedly a plot implicating her had been uncovered, and she had been summarily executed.  However, her ghost had appeared to Eadwyre in a dream and revealed to him that the true Emperor had been kidnapped by Tharn and imprisoned in an alternate dimension.  Tharn had then used the Staff of Chaos to kill her when she attempted to warn the Elder Council of his nefarious plot.""},{""text1"":""Together, Eadwyre and Barenziah plotted to gain the false Emperor's confidence.  Meanwhile, another friend of Ria's, known only as the Champion, who apparently possessed great, albeit then untapped, potential, was incarcerated at the Imperial Dungeons.  However, she had access to his dreams, and she told him to bide his time until she could devise a plan that would effect his escape.  Then he could begin on his mission to unmask the impostor.""},{""text1"":""Barenziah continued to charm, and eventually befriended, the ersatz Emperor.  By contriving to read his secret diary, she learned that he had broken the Staff of Chaos into eight pieces and hidden them in far-flung locations scattered across Tamriel.  She managed to obtain a copy of the key to Ria's friend's cell and bribed a guard to leave it there as if by accident.  Their Champion, whose name was unknown even to Barenziah and Eadwyre, made his escape through a shift gate Ria had opened in an obscure corner of the Imperial Dungeons using her already failing powers.  The Champion was free at last, and almost immediately went to work.""},{""text1"":""It took Barenziah several more months to learn the hiding places of all eight Staff pieces through snatches of overheard conversation and rare glances at Tharn's diary.  Once she had the vital information, however -- which she communicated to Ria forthwith, who in turn passed it on to the Champion-she and Eadwyre lost no time.  They fled to Wayrest, his ancestral kingdom in the province of High Rock, where they managed to fend off the sporadic efforts of Tharn's henchmen to haul them back to the Imperial City, or at the very least obtain revenge.  Tharn, whatever else might be said of him, was no one's fool-save perhaps Barenziah's -- and he concentrated most of his efforts toward tracking down and destroying the Champion.""},{""text1"":""As all now know, the courageous, indefatigable, and forever nameless Champion was successful in reuniting the eight sundered pieces of the Staff of Chaos.  With it, he destroyed Tharn and rescued the true Emperor, Uriel Septim VII.  Following what has come to be known as the Restoration, a grand state memorial service was held for Symmachus at the Imperial City, befitting the man who had served the Septim Dynasty for so long and so well.""},{""text1"":""Barenziah and good King Eadwyre had come to care deeply for one another during their trials and adventures, and were married in the same year shortly after their flight from the Imperial City.  Her two children from her previous marriage with Symmachus remained with her, and a regent was appointed to rule Mournhold in her absence.""},{""text1"":""Up to the present time, Queen Barenziah has been in Wayrest with Prince Helseth and Princess Morgiah.  She plans to return to Mournhold after Eadwyre's death.  Since he was already elderly when they wed, she knows that that event, alas, could not be far off as the Elves reckon time.  Until then, she shares in the government of the kingdom of Wayrest with her husband, and seems glad and content with her finally quiet, and happily unremarkable, life.""},{""text1"":"" ""}]"

They would tell him how to plant his feet, how to nock a bolt, the proper grip for the cord, the best method of release. He ignored all the rules, and somehow, every time, the arrow would catch a breath of wind and sail directly to his target.

Despite this, or perhaps because of it, omens and prophesies abound in Tamriel, some of substance, others of pure folly, and still others so ambiguous as to be unverifiable.  There are still other prophesies kept secret, from the prophesies of Dro'Jizad in Elsweyr and the Nerevarine in Morrowind, to the Elder Scrolls themselves.""},{""text1"":""The Nord nobility have a tradition of having omens read for their children.  In general, these readings are of the obscure variety.  One of my acquaintances told me that her parents were told, for example, that their daughter would have her life rescued by a snake, and so gave her the name Serpentkin in a special ceremony.  And this young lady, Eria Valkor Serpentkin, was indeed saved by a snake many years later, when an assassin creeping on her stepped on a danswyrm viper.""},{""text1"":""Occasionally, omens seem to be almost purposefully misleading, as if Boethiah had crafted them as traps.  I recall one particularly.  Many, many years ago, a male child was born into House Redoran.  It was a very difficult birth, and the mother was delirious and near death by the time it was over.  She chanted just as her son came into the world and she passed from it.""},{""text1"":""Fortune has smiled this day not frowned\nMy child will be mighty in mind and in arm\nHe shall bring hope to House Redoran\nNeither spell nor blade shall hurt the man\nNor illness nor poison cause any harm\nHis blood shall never drop on the ground""},{""text1"":""The boy, named Andas, was indeed extraordinary.  He never was ill and never suffered so much as a scratch all through his childhood.  He was also quite intelligent and strong, which, combined with his invulnerability, caused many to call him, after his mother's omen, the Hope of the Redoran.  Of course, any one who is called the Hope of the Redoran will eventually develop some taint of impertinence, and it wasn't long before he had enemies.""},{""text1"":""His worst enemy was his cousin Athyn, who had borne much abuse at the hands of Andas.  Primary among the grudges was that Athyn had been sent to Rihad to complete his education at Andas's insistence.  When Athyn returned from Hammerfell, it was because of the death of his father, who had also been a councilor of the House.  Athyn was old enough to take his seat in the Council, but Andas claimed the seat as well, saying that his cousin had been gone too long from Morrowind and didn't understand politics as he did.  The majority of the House agreed with Andas, wanting to see the Hope of Redoran rise quickly.""},{""text1"":""Athyn exercised his right to combat his cousin for the seat.  No one thought he had any chance of winning, of course, but the battle was scheduled to commence the following morn.  Andas whored and dined and drank with the councilors that night, confident that his place in the House was secured and the hopeful new dawn of House Redoran was rising.  Athyn retired to his castle with his friends, Andas's enemies, and his servants he had brought from Hammerfell.""},{""text1"":""Athyn and his friends were discussing the duel morosely when one of his old teachers, a warrior called Shardie, came into the hall.

Are swords and spears and arrows the only items in your arsenal?\""""},{""text1"":""Athyn quickly realized the weapon Shardie was speaking of, but it seemed absurd.  Not only absurd, but pathetic and primitive.  Still, it was the only hope he had.  All that night, Shardie trained him in the art and techniques, showing him the various swings and stances her people had developed in Albion-Gora; counter-attacks, feints, and blocks imported from Yokuda; the classic one and two-handed grips for the most ancient weapon in history.""},{""text1"":""The cousins faced one another the next morning, and never have two combatants looked so unevenly matched.  Andas's entrance brought a great cheer, for not only was he much beloved as the Hope of the Redoran, but as his victory was a foregone conclusion, most wanted to be in good standing with him.  His shining mail and blade drew admiration and awe.  By contrast, Athyn drew a gasp of surprise and only a smattering of polite applause.  He appeared costumed and armed like a barbarian.""},{""text1"":""As Shardie had suggested, Athyn allowed Andas to attack first.  The Hope of the Redoran was eager to finish the battle and take the power he deserved quickly.  The blade pushed by Andas's mighty arm slashed across Athyn's chest, but shallowly, and before it could be counterswung, Athyn knocked it back with his own weapon.  When Athyn attacked and wounded Andas, the Hope of the Redoran was so surprised by being hurt for the first time in his life, he dropped his sword.""},{""text1"":""The less said about the end of the battle, the better.  Suffice it to say that Athyn, wielding a simple club, battered Andas to death without spilling a drop of blood.""},{""text1"":""Athyn took his father's seat as councilor, and it was then said that the hope in the omen referred to Athyn, not Andas.  After all, had Andas not tried to take the councilor seat away from his cousin, Athyn, being not very ambitious, might have never tried to get it.  It can certainly be argued that way, I suppose. ""}]"

Only in Skyrim did this accommodation break down, an event recorded in the Song of Return. Perhaps, being close to reinforcements from Atmora, the proto-Nords did not feel it necessary to submit to the authority of the Skyrim Elves. Indeed, the early Nord chronicles note that under King Harald, the first historical Nord ruler (1E 113-221), \""the Atmoran mercenaries returned to their homeland\"" following the consolidation of Skyrim as a centralized kingdom. Whatever the case, the pattern was set -- in Skyrim, expansion would proceed militarily, with human settlement following the frontier of conquest, and the line between Human territory and Elven territory was relatively clear.""},{""text1"":""But beyond this \""zone of conflict,\"" the other Nedic peoples continued to merge with their Elven neighbors.

His son and successor Uriel II reigned for eighteen years, from the death of Uriel I in 3E64 to Pelagius II's accession in 3E82.

And so the worlds called to something to save them, to let them out, but of course there was nothing outside the First Serpent, so aid had to come from inside it; this was Akel, the Hungry Stomach. Akel made itself known, and Satak could only think about what it was, and it was the best hunger, so it ate and ate. Soon there was enough room to live in the worlds and things began. These things were new and they often made mistakes, for there was hardly time to practice being things before. So most things ended quickly or were not good or gave up on themselves. Some things were about to start, but they were eaten up as Satak got to that part of its body.

As the old world died, Satakal began, and when things realized this pattern so did they realize what their part in it was. They began to take names, like Ruptga or Tuwhacca, and they strode about looking for their kin. As Satakal ate itself over and over, the strongest spirits learned to bypass the cycle by moving at strange angles. They called this process the Walkabout, a way of striding between the worldskins. Ruptga was so big that he was able to place the stars in the sky so that weaker spirits might find their way easier. This practice became so easy for the spirits that it became a place, called the Far Shores, a time of waiting until the next skin.""},{""text"":""\t\""Ruptga was able to sire many children through the cycles and so he became known as the Tall Papa. He continued to place stars to map out the void for others, but after so many cycles there were almost too many spirits to help out. He made himself a helper from the detritus of past skins and this was Sep, or Second Serpent. Sep had much of the Hungry Stomach still left in him, multiple hungers from multiple skins. He was so hungry he could not think straight. Sometimes he would just eat the spirits he was supposed to help, but Tall Papa would always reach in and take them back out. Finally, tired of helping Tall Papa, Sep went and gathered the rest of the old skins and balled them up, tricking spirits to help him, promising them this was how you reached the new world, by making one out of the old. These spirits loved this way of living, as it was easier. No more jumping from place to place. Many spirits joined in, believing this was good thinking. Tall Papa just shook his head.""},{""text"":""\t\""Pretty soon the spirits on the skin-ball started to die, because they were very far from the real world of Satakal.

But grim Ruptga would not, and he told the spirits that they must learn new ways to follow the stars to the Far Shores now. If they could not, then they must live on through their children, which was not the same as before. Sep, however, needed more punishment, and so Tall Papa squashed the Snake with a big stick. The hunger fell out of Sep's dead mouth and was the only thing left of the Second Serpent. While the rest of the new world was allowed to strive back to godhood, Sep could only slink around in a dead skin, or swim about in the sky, a hungry void that jealously tried to eat the stars.\""""},{""text"":""Monomyth: Cyrodiilic \""Shezarr's Song\""""},{""text"":""Note: This part was known as the Cyrodiilic Creation Myth.""},{""text"":""\t\""This was a new thing that Shezarr described to the Gods, becoming mothers and fathers, being responsible, and making great sacrifices, with no guarantee of success, but Shezarr spoke beautifully to them, and moved them beyond mystery and tears. Thus the Aedra gave free birth to the world, the beasts, and the beings, making these things from parts of themselves. This free birth was very painful, and afterwards the Aedra were no longer young, and strong, and powerful, as they had been from the beginning of days.""},{""text"":""\t\""Some Aedra were disappointed and bitter in their loss, and angry with Shezarr, and with all creation, for they felt Shezarr had lied and tricked them. These Aedra, the Gods of the Aldmer, led by Auri-El, were disgusted by their enfeebled selves, and by what they had created. 'Everything is spoiled, for now, and for all time, and the most we can do is teach the Elven Races to suffer nobly, with dignity, and chastise ourselves for our folly, and avenge ourselves upon Shezarr and his allies.' Thus are the Gods of the Elves dark and brooding, and thus are the Elves ever dissatisfied with mortality, and always proud and stoic despite the harshness of this cruel and indifferent world.""},{""text"":""\t\""Other Aedra looked upon creation, and were well pleased. These Aedra, the Gods of Men and Beast Folk, led by Akatosh, praised and cherished their wards, the Mortal Races. 'We have suffered, and are diminished, for all time, but the mortal world we have made is glorious, filling our hearts and spirits with hope. Let us teach the Mortal Races to live well, to cherish beauty and honor, and to love one another as we love them.' Thus are the Gods of Men tender and patient, and thus are Men and Beast Folk great in heart for joy or suffering, and ambitious for greater wisdom and a better world.""},{""text"":""\t\""Now when the Daedra Lords heard Shezarr, they mocked him, and the other Aedra.

And, for the most part, the Daedra Lords were well pleased with this arrangement, for they always had worshippers and servants and playthings close to hand. But, at the same time, they sometimes looked with envy upon the Mortal Realms, for though mortals were foul and feeble and contemptible, their passions and ambitions were also far more surprising and entertaining than the antics of the Lesser Daedra. Thus do the Daedra Lords court and seduce certain amusing specimens of the Mortal Races, especially the passionate and powerful. It gives the Daedra Lords special pleasure to steal away from Shezarr and the Aedra the greatest and most ambitious mortals. 'Not only are you fools to mutilate yourselves,' gloat the Daedra Lords, 'But you cannot even keep the best pieces, which prefer the glory and power of the Daedra Lords to the feeble vulgarity of the mush-minded Aedra.'\""""},{""text"":""Monomyth: Altmeri \""The Heart of the World\""""},{""text"":""Note: This part was known as the High Elven (Altmeri) Creation Myth.""},{""text"":""\t\""Anu encompassed, and encompasses, all things.

With time, various aspects of the Aurbis began to understand their natures and limitations. They took names, like Magnus or Mara or Xen. One of these, Lorkhan, was more of a limit than a nature, so he could never last long anywhere.""},{""text"":""\t\""As he entered every aspect of Anuiel, Lorkhan would plant an idea that was almost wholly based on limitation.

So they created the Mundus, where their own aspects might live, and became the et'Ada.""},{""text"":""\t\""But this was a trick. As Lorkhan knew, this world contained more limitations than not and was therefore hardly a thing of Anu at all. Mundus was the House of Sithis. As their aspects began to die off, many of the et'Ada vanished completely. Some escaped, like Magnus, and that is why there are no limitations to magic. Others, like Y'ffre, transformed themselves into the Ehlnofey, the Earthbones, so that the whole world might not die. Some had to marry and make children just to last. Each generation was weaker than the last, and soon there were Aldmer. Darkness caved in.

He made himself a helper from the detritus of past skins and this was Sep, or Second Serpent. Sep had much of the Hungry Stomach still left in him, multiple hungers from multiple skins. He was so hungry he could not think straight. Sometimes he would just eat the spirits he was supposed to help, but Tall Papa would always reach in and take them back out. Finally, tired of helping Tall Papa, Sep went and gathered the rest of the old skins and balled them up, tricking spirits to help him, promising them this was how you reached the new world, by making one out of the old. These spirits loved this way of living, as it was easier. No more jumping from place to place. Many spirits joined in, believing this was good thinking. Tall Papa just shook his head.""},{""text1"":""\t\""Pretty soon the spirits on the skin-ball started to die, because they were very far from the real world of Satakal. And they found that it was too far to jump into the Far Shores now. The spirits that were left pleaded with Tall Papa to take them back. But grim Ruptga would not, and he told the spirits that they must learn new ways to follow the stars to the Far Shores now. If they could not, then they must live on through their children, which was not the same as before. Sep, however, needed more punishment, and so Tall Papa squashed the Snake with a big stick. The hunger fell out of Sep's dead mouth and was the only thing left of the Second Serpent. While the rest of the new world was allowed to strive back to godhood, Sep could only slink around in a dead skin, or swim about in the sky, a hungry void that jealously tried to eat the stars.\""""},{""text1"":""Note: This part was known as the Cyrodiilic Creation Myth.""},{""text1"":""\t\""This was a new thing that Shezarr described to the Gods, becoming mothers and fathers, being responsible, and making great sacrifices, with no guarantee of success, but Shezarr spoke beautifully to them, and moved them beyond mystery and tears. Thus the Aedra gave free birth to the world, the beasts, and the beings, making these things from parts of themselves. This free birth was very painful, and afterwards the Aedra were no longer young, and strong, and powerful, as they had been from the beginning of days.""},{""text1"":""\t\""Some Aedra were disappointed and bitter in their loss, and angry with Shezarr, and with all creation, for they felt Shezarr had lied and tricked them. These Aedra, the Gods of the Aldmer, led by Auri-El, were disgusted by their enfeebled selves, and by what they had created. 'Everything is spoiled, for now, and for all time, and the most we can do is teach the Elven Races to suffer nobly, with dignity, and chastise ourselves for our folly, and avenge ourselves upon Shezarr and his allies.' Thus are the Gods of the Elves dark and brooding, and thus are the Elves ever dissatisfied with mortality, and always proud and stoic despite the harshness of this cruel and indifferent world.""},{""text1"":""\t\""Other Aedra looked upon creation, and were well pleased. These Aedra, the Gods of Men and Beast Folk, led by Akatosh, praised and cherished their wards, the Mortal Races. 'We have suffered, and are diminished, for all time, but the mortal world we have made is glorious, filling our hearts and spirits with hope. Let us teach the Mortal Races to live well, to cherish beauty and honor, and to love one another as we love them.' Thus are the Gods of Men tender and patient, and thus are Men and Beast Folk great in heart for joy or suffering, and ambitious for greater wisdom and a better world.""},{""text1"":""\t\""Now when the Daedra Lords heard Shezarr, they mocked him, and the other Aedra. 'Cut parts of ourselves off? And lose them? Forever? That's stupid! You'll be sorry! We are far smarter than you, for we will create a new world out of ourselves, but we will not cut it off, or let it mock us, but we will make this world within ourselves, forever ours, and under our complete control.'""},{""text1"":""\t\""So the Daedra Lords created the Daedric Realms, and all the ranks of Lesser Daedra, great and small. And, for the most part, the Daedra Lords were well pleased with this arrangement, for they always had worshippers and servants and playthings close to hand. But, at the same time, they sometimes looked with envy upon the Mortal Realms, for though mortals were foul and feeble and contemptible, their passions and ambitions were also far more surprising and entertaining than the antics of the Lesser Daedra. Thus do the Daedra Lords court and seduce certain amusing specimens of the Mortal Races, especially the passionate and powerful. It gives the Daedra Lords special pleasure to steal away from Shezarr and the Aedra the greatest and most ambitious mortals. 'Not only are you fools to mutilate yourselves,' gloat the Daedra Lords, 'But you cannot even keep the best pieces, which prefer the glory and power of the Daedra Lords to the feeble vulgarity of the mush-minded Aedra.'\""""},{""text1"":""Note: This part was known as the High Elven (Altmeri) Creation Myth.""},{""text1"":""\t\""Anu encompassed, and encompasses, all things. So that he might know himself he created Anuiel, his soul and the soul of all things. Anuiel, as all souls, was given to self-reflection, and for this he needed to differentiate between his forms, attributes, and intellects. Thus was born Sithis, who was the sum of all the limitations Anuiel would utilize to ponder himself. Anuiel, who was the soul of all things, therefore became many things, and this interplay was and is the Aurbis.""},{""text1"":""\t\""At first the Aurbis was turbulent and confusing, as Anuiel's ruminations went on without design. Aspects of the Aurbis then asked for a schedule to follow or procedures whereby they might enjoy themselves a little longer outside of perfect knowledge. So that he might know himself this way, too, Anu created Auriel, the soul of his soul. Auriel bled through the Aurbis as a new force, called time. With time, various aspects of the Aurbis began to understand their natures and limitations. They took names, like Magnus or Mara or Xen. One of these, Lorkhan, was more of a limit than a nature, so he could never last long anywhere.""},{""text1"":""\t\""As he entered every aspect of Anuiel, Lorkhan would plant an idea that was almost wholly based on limitation. He outlined a plan to create a soul for the Aurbis, a place where the aspects of aspects might even be allowed to self-reflect. He gained many followers; even Auriel, when told he would become the king of the new world, agreed to help Lorkhan. So they created the Mundus, where their own aspects might live, and became the et'Ada.""},{""text1"":""\t\""But this was a trick. As Lorkhan knew, this world contained more limitations than not and was therefore hardly a thing of Anu at all. Mundus was the House of Sithis. As their aspects began to die off, many of the et'Ada vanished completely. Some escaped, like Magnus, and that is why there are no limitations to magic. Others, like Y'ffre, transformed themselves into the Ehlnofey, the Earthbones, so that the whole world might not die. Some had to marry and make children just to last. Each generation was weaker than the last, and soon there were Aldmer. Darkness caved in. Lorkhan made armies out of the weakest souls and named them Men, and they brought Sithis into every quarter.""},{""text1"":""\t\""Auriel pleaded with Anu to take them back, but he had already filled their places with something else. But his soul was gentler and granted Auriel his Bow and Shield, so that he might save the Aldmer from the hordes of Men. Some had already fallen, like the Chimer, who listened to tainted et'Ada, and others, like the Bosmer, had soiled Time's line by taking Mannish wives.""},{""text1"":""\t\""Auriel could not save Altmora, the Elder Wood, and it was lost to Men. They were chased south and east to Old Ehlnofey, and Lorkhan was close behind. He shattered that land into many. Finally Trinimac, Auriel's greatest knight, knocked Lorkhan down in front of his army and reached in with more than hands to take his Heart. He was undone. The Men dragged Lorkhan's body away and swore blood vengeance on the heirs of Auriel for all time.""},{""text1"":""\t\""But when Trinimac and Auriel tried to destroy the Heart of Lorkhan it laughed at them. It said, \""This Heart is the heart of the world, for one was made to satisfy the other.\"" So Auriel fastened the thing to an arrow and let it fly long into the sea, where no aspect of the new world may ever find it.\""""}]"

Splintering the diamond and powdering the pieces required the bulk of the time; over and over again, she waved her gnarled hands over the gem, intoning ancient enchantments, breaking the facets of the stone into smaller and smaller pieces.

A quiet and reserved man who never drank, never visited a brothel or even uttered a curse, he was famous for his ability to make people disappear. Once a person was targeted by the Brotherhood and Torik was sent to them, they would simply cease to be. I asked him once what his weapon of choice was, and was equally startled by his answer.""},{""text1"":""\t“I only likes to use axes,” he said in his typical, quiet voice.""},{""text1"":""\tThe image of this silent, dour fellow attacking anyone with a weapon as inherently bloody and violent as an axe so frightened and intrigued me that I questioned him about it further. This is an inherently dangerous activity, for assassins are not typically keen to give out their stories. Torik did not mind the questions, though it took some time to get the full story out of him, as naturally shy and reserved as he was.""},{""text1"":""\tIt seemed that Torik had been orphaned as a very young age and sent to live with his uncle, a saltrice plantation owner in Sheogorad in northern Vvardenfell. The man promised to show his nephew the business and eventually make him a partner when he was old enough. In the meantime, the boy was put to work as his uncle's house servant.""},{""text1"":""\tIt was a grueling life as the old man was very particular about how things should be done. The boy was first required to give all the floors in the house a thorough scouring, from the attic to the cellar. Whenever the floor was not cleaned to the uncle's satisfaction, which was frequent, Torik was thrashed and forced to begin again.""},{""text1"":""\tThe boy's second duty was to ring the bell that would bring the laborers into the house. This was done at least four times a day, once for each meal, but if his uncle had any news or additional instructions for the laborers -- which he frequently did -- the bell might need to be sounded a dozen times or more. It was a huge iron bell in the tower and the boy quickly discovered that he had to throw his entire body into the motion of pulling the chain in order to have it sound loud enough to bring everyone in from the field. If he was tired and did not pull the backbreaking chain hard enough, his uncle was soon at his side to beat him until he rang the bell loud and clear.""},{""text1"":""\tTorik's third task was dusting all the shelves in his uncle's vast library. As deep and old as the shelves were, he was required to work with a long, heavy duster on a rod. The only way that he could reach to the back of the shelves was to hold the duster at his shoulder and then swing it out in a sweeping motion. Again, if the uncle saw any dust left over or felt that the boy was not working as hard as he ought to, the punishment was swift and severe.""},{""text1"":""\tAfter several years, Minas Torik grew into a young man, but his job responsibilities were not increased. His uncle promised to teach him the business, once Torik had demonstrated his mastery of his servile assignments. Divorced from any knowledge of any work other than his own, Torik never knew how badly in debt his uncle was and how poorly the farm's yield was.""},{""text1"":""\tIn his eighteenth year, Torik was called into the cellar by his uncle. He thought that he had not done a good enough job scouring the floor down there, and was frightened of the beating to come. What he found, however, was his uncle packing his goods into crates.""},{""text1"":""\t“I'm leaving Morrowind,” he explained. “The business has gone sour, so I thought I'd try my luck running a caravan in Skyrim. I understand there's good money to be made, trading fake Dwemer artifacts to the Nords and Cyrodiils. I wish I could take you with me, my lad, but there won't be much need for scouring, bell pulling, and dusting where I'm going.”""},{""text1"":""\t“But uncle,” said Torik. “I can't read, I knows nothing of the business you promised to teach me. What wills I dos on my own?”""},{""text1"":""\t“I'm certain you can find a job in some domestic capacity,” shrugged the uncle. “I've done my best with you.”""},{""text1"":""\tTorik had never stood up to his uncle before, and felt no anger only a sort of coldness that gripped his heart. Among his uncle's possessions being packed away was an old heavy iron axe, allegedly of Dwemer manufacture. He picked it up in his hands and was surprised to find that it was not much heavier than his dusting rod. In fact, it felt very comfortable as he pulled it over his shoulder and swung it out as he had done so many times before. In this instance, however, he swung it into his uncle's right arm.""},{""text1"":""\tThe old man screamed with pain and rage, but for some reason, Torik didn't feel frightened anymore. He propped the axe against his other shoulder, and swung it out again. It cut a swath across the old man's chest and he fell to the floor.""},{""text1"":""\tTorik hesitated before lifting the axe above his head. It was another natural position for him, like he was ringing a bell. Over and over again, he swung down as if he was calling the laborers in from the field. Except that this time, there was no sound except for a wet thump, and no laborers came in from the field. Of course, his uncle had sent them away hours before.""},{""text1"":""\tAfter a time, there was nothing left of his uncle that couldn't be washed down the cellar drain. The process of cleaning up came easily to Torik as well. Blood scrubbed up much quicker than the usual grime and saltrice flour that littered the cellar floor.""},{""text1"":""\tIt was well known that Torik's uncle was planning to leave Morrowind, so his disappearance provoked no suspicion. The house and all the belongings were sold to the debt collectors, but Torik took the axe. It seemed that his uncle had given him some worthwhile business skills after all.""}]"

News from the scouts reported that the Chimeri forces had just left Narsis, and that they were taking their time joining their cousins against the Nords. Dagoth-Ur said that the Tribunal had betrayed their King's trust, that they sent Dagoth-Ur to Lorkhan (for that is what they called Shor in Resdayn) so that the god might wreak vengeance on the Dwarves for their hubris; that Nerevar's peace with the Dwemer would be the ruin of the Velothi way.

Later, Kyne lifted the ashes of the ashes of Ysmir into the sky, saving him from Hell and showing her sons the color of blood when it is brought by betrayal. And the Nords will never trust another Devil again.""},{""text1"":""The Truth at Red Mountain""},{""text1"":""The Heart of Shor was in Resdayn, as Dagoth-Ur had promised. As Shor's army approached the westernmost bank of the Inner Sea, they stared across at Red Mountain, where the Dwemeri armies had gathered. News from the scouts reported that the Chimeri forces had just left Narsis, and that they were taking their time joining their cousins against the Nords. Dagoth-Ur said that the Tribunal had betrayed their King's trust, that they sent Dagoth-Ur to Lorkhan (for that is what they called Shor in Resdayn) so that the god might wreak vengeance on the Dwarves for their hubris; that Nerevar's peace with the Dwemer would be the ruin of the Velothi way. This was the reason for the slow muster, Dagoth-Ur said.""},{""text1"":""The Armies Grow""},{""text1"":""And Lorkhan (for that is what they called Shor in Resdayn) said: “I do not wreak vengeance on the Dwarves for the reasons that the Tribunal might believe I do. Nevertheless, it is true that they will die by my hand, and any whoever should side with them. This Nerevar is the son of Boethiah, one of the strongest Padomaics. He is a hero to his people despite his Tribunal, and he shall muster enough that this battle will be harder going still. We will need more than what we have.” And so Dagoth-Ur, who wanted the Dwarves as dead as the Tribunal did, went to Kogoran and summoned his House chap'thil, his nix-hounds, his wizards, archers, his stolen men of brass. And the Ash King, Wulfharth, hoary Ysmir, went and made peace with the Orcs in spite of his Nordic blood, and they brought many warriors but no wizards at all. Many Nords could not bring themselves to ally with their traditional enemies, even in the face of Red Mountain. They were close to desertion. Then Wulfharth said: “Don't you see where you really are? Don't you know who Shor really is? Don't you know what this war is?” And they looked from the King to the God to the Devils and Orcs, and some knew, really knew, and they are the ones that stayed.""},{""text1"":""The Doom Drum""},{""text1"":""Nerevar carried Keening, a dagger made of the sound of the shadow of the moons. His champions were Dumac Dwarfking, who carried a hammer of divine mass, and Alandro Sul, who was the immortal son of Azura and wore the Wraith Mail. They met Lorkhan at the last battle of Red Mountain. Lorkhan had his Heart again, but he had long been from it, and he needed time. Wulfharth met Sul but could not strike him, and he fell from grievous wounds, but not before shouting Sul blind. Dagoth-Ur met Dumac and slew him, but not before Sunder struck his lord's Heart. Nerevar turned away from Lorkhan and struck down Dagoth-Ur in rage, but he took a mortal wound from Lorkhan in turn. But Nerevar feigned the death that was coming early and so struck Lorkhan with surprise on his side. The Heart had been made solid by Sunder's tuning blow and Keening could now cut it out. And it was cut out and Lorkhan was defeated and the whole ordeal was thought over. ""}]"

The sight was so otherworldly that I was mesmerized by it, and the strange Redguard figures immortalized in stone.

It was clearly a realistic depiction.  Pariom's face was plain, even slightly ugly with a low forehead, a mass of tangled hair, stubble on his cheeks.  Even a slight gap in his teeth, which no sculptor would surely have invented except to do justice to his model's true idiosyncrasies.""},{""text"":""\""And your mother?\"" I asked, pointing to a nearby statue of a proud, rather squat warrior woman in a mantilla and scarf, holding a child.""},{""text"":""\""Oh no,\"" she laughed. \""That was my uncle's old nurse.

In all likelihood, it was nothing but fate, and a selfish desire to continue the conversation.   I was afraid that if I did not give her a project, she would feel the need to return to the party, and I would be alone again.  At first she was reluctant.  She had not yet made up her mind whether the statues would suffer in the wet, sometimes cold Cyrodilic climate.  Perhaps all should be covered, she reasoned.  It may be that she was merely making conversation, and was reluctant as I was to end the stand-off and be that much closer to having to return to the party.""},{""text"":""In a few minutes time, we tore the tarp from the statue of Betaniqi's mother.  That is when my life changed forevermore.""},{""text"":""She was an untamed spirit of nature, screaming in a struggle with a misshapen monstrous figure in black marble.  Her gorgeous, long fingers were raking across the creature's face.  The monster's talons gripped her right breast in a sort of caress that prefaces a mortal wound.  Its legs and hers wound around one another in a battle that was a dance.  I felt annihilated.  This lithe but formidable woman was beautiful beyond all superficial standards.  Whoever had sculpted it had somehow captured not only a face and figure of a goddess, but her power and will.  She was both tragic and triumphant.  I fell instantly and fatally in love with her.""},{""text"":""I had not even noticed when Gelyn, one of my fellow initiates who was leaving the party, came up behind us.

My lips would silently purse to voice the \""Pal,\"" and tongue lightly flick to form the \""La\"" as if I were kissing her spirit before me.  It was madness in every way except that I knew that it was madness.  I knew I was in love.  I knew she was a noble Redguard woman, a fierce warrior more beautiful than the stars.  I knew her young daughter Betaniqi had taken possession of a manorhouse near the Guild, and that she liked me, perhaps was even infatuated.  I knew Palla had fought a terrible beast and killed it.  I knew Palla was dead.""},{""text"":""As I say, I knew it was madness, and by that, I knew I could not be mad.

An Altmer from the Summurset Isle.\""""},{""text"":""\""Scandal!\""""},{""text"":""\""It was, absolutely,\"" Betaniqi nodded seriously. \""The idea that a pompous, wicked elf's hands had formed these figures of noble Redguard warriors was unthinkable, profane, irreverent, everything bad you can imagine.  But my great grandfather's heart was in the beauty of it, and his philosophy of using the best to honor the best passed down to us all.  I would not have even considered having a lesser artist create the statues of my parents, even if it would have been more allegiant to my culture.\""""},{""text"":""\""They're all exquisite,\"" I said.""},{""text"":""\""But you like the one of my mother most of all,\"" she smiled. \""I see you look at it even when you seem to be looking at the others.

We have a great many business interests and she was brilliant at managing everything.  Certainly better than I am now.  All it took was her smile and everyone obeyed, and those that didn't paid dearly.  She was very witty and charming, but a formidable force when the need arose for her to fight.  Hundreds of battles, but I can never remember a moment of feeling neglected or unloved.  I literally thought she was too strong for death.   Stupid, I know, but when she went to battle that -- that horrible creature, that freak from a mad wizard's laboratory, I never even thought she would not return.  She was kind to her friends and ruthless to her enemies.  What more can one say about a woman than that?\""""},{""text"":""Poor Betaniqi's eyes teared up with remembrance.  What sort of villain was I to goad her so, in order to satisfy my perverted longings?  Sheogorath could never have conflicted a mortal man more than me.

Palla not only looked like a goddess, but from her daughter's story, she was one.""},{""text"":""That night while undressing for bed, I rediscovered the black disc I had stolen from Magister Tendixus's office weeks before.  I had half-forgotten about its existence, that mysterious necromantic artifact which the mage believed could resurrect a dead love.  Almost by pure instinct, I found myself placing the disc on my heart and whispering, \""Palla.\""""},{""text"":""A momentary chill filled my chamber.  My breath hung in the air in a mist before dissipating.  Frightened I dropped the disc.  It took a moment before my reason returned, and with it the inescapable conclusion: the artifact could fulfill my desire.""},{""text"":""Until the early morning hours, I tried to raise my mistress from the chains of Oblivion, but it was no use.  I was no necromancer.  I entertained thoughts of how to ask one of the Magisters to help me, but I remembered how Magister Ilther had bid me to destroy it.  They would expel me from the Guild if I went to them and destroy the disc themselves.  And with it, my only key to bringing my love to me.""},{""text"":""I was in my usual semi-torpid condition the next day in classes.  Magister Ilther himself was lecturing on his specialty, the School of Enchantment.  He was a dull speaker with a monotone voice, but suddenly I felt as if every shadow had left the room and I was in a palace of light.""},{""text"":""\""When most persons think of my particular science, they think of the process of invention.  The infusing of charms and spells into objects.  The creation of a magickal blade, perhaps, or a ring.  But the skilled enchanter is also a catalyst.  The same mind that can create something new can also provoke greater power from something old.  A ring that can generate warmth for a novice, on the hand of such a talent can bake a forest black.\"" The fat man chuckled: \""Not that I'm advocating that.  Leave that for the School of Destruction.\""""},{""text"":""That week all the initiates were asked to choose a field of specialization.  All were surprised when I turned my back on my old darling, the School of Illusion.  It seemed ridiculous to me that I had ever entertained an affection for such superficial charms.  All my intellect was now focused on the School of Enchantment, the means by which I could free the power of the disc.""},{""text"":""For months thereafter, I barely slept.  A few hours a week, I'd spend with Betaniqi and my statue to give myself strength and inspiration.  All the rest of my time was spent with Magister Ilther or his assistants, learning everything I could about enchantment.  They taught me how to taste the deepest levels of magicka within a stored object.""},{""text"":""\""A simple spell cast once, no matter how skillfully and no matter how spectacularly, is ephemeral, of the present, what it is and no more,\"" sighed Magister Ilther. \""But placed in a home, it develops into an almost living energy, maturing and ripening so only its surface is touched when an unskilled hand wields it.  You must consider yourself a miner, digging deeper to pull forth the very heart of gold.\""""},{""text"":""Every night when the laboratory closed, I practiced what I had learned.  I could feel my power grow and with it, the power of the disc.  Whispering \""Palla,\"" I delved into the artifact, feeling every slight nick that marked the runes and every facet of the gemstones.  At times I was so close to her, I felt hands touching mine.  But something dark and bestial, the reality of death I suppose, would always break across the dawning of my dream.  With it came an overwhelming rotting odor, which the initiates in the chambers next to mine began to complain about.""},{""text"":""\""Something must have crawled into the floorboards and died,\"" I offered lamely.""},{""text"":""Magister Ilther praised my scholarship, and allowed me the use of his laboratory after hours to further my studies.  Yet no matter what I learned, Palla seemed scarcely closer.  One night, it all ended.  I was swaying in a deep ecstasy, moaning her name, the disc bruising my chest, when a sudden lightning flash through the window broke my concentration.  A tempest of furious rain roared over Mir Corrup.  I went to close the shutters, and when I returned to my table, I found that the disc had shattered.""},{""text"":""I broke into hysterical sobs and then laughter.  It was too much for my fragile mind to bear such a loss after so much time and study.  The next day and the day after, I spent in my bed, burning with a fever.  Had I not been a Mages Guild with so many healers, I likely would have died.  As it was, I provided an excellent study for the budding young scholars.""},{""text"":""When at last I was well enough to walk, I went to visit Betaniqi.  She was charming as always, never once commenting on my appearance, which must have been ghastly.  Finally I gave her reason to worry when I politely but firmly declined to walk with her along the reflecting pool.""},{""text"":""\""But you love looking at the statuary,\"" she exclaimed.""},{""text"":""I felt that I owed her the truth and much more. \""Dear lady, I love more than the statuary.  I love your mother.  She is all I've been able to think about for months now, ever since you and I first removed the tarp from that blessed sculpture.

Intrigues at the Imperial and various royal courts were analyzed, gently mocked, fretted over, toasted, dismissed, evaluated, mitigated, admonished, subverted.  No one looked our way even when we were right next to them.  It was as if my skill at illusion had somehow rendered us all invisible.""},{""text1"":""I took my flagon out to the terrace.  The moons were doubled, equally luminous in the sky and in the enormous reflecting pool that stretched out into the garden.  The white marble statuary lining the sides of the pool caught the fiery glow and seemed to burn like torches in the night.  The sight was so otherworldly that I was mesmerized by it, and the strange Redguard figures immortalized in stone.  Our hostess had made her home there so recently that some of the sculptures were still wrapped in sheets that billowed and swayed in the gentle breeze.  I don't know how long I stared before I realized I wasn't alone.""},{""text1"":""She was so small and so dark, not only in her skin but in her clothing, that I nearly took her for a shadow.  When she turned to me, I saw that she was very beautiful and young, not more than seventeen.""},{""text1"":""\""Are you our hostess?\"" I finally asked.""},{""text1"":""\""Yes,\"" she smiled, blushing. \""But I'm ashamed to admit that I'm very bad at it.  I should be inside with my new neighbors, but I think we have very little in common.\""""},{""text1"":""\""It's been made abundantly clear that they hope I have nothing in common with them either,\"" I laughed.  \""When I'm a little higher than an initiate in the Mages Guild, they might see me as more of an equal.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I don't understand the concept of equality in Cyrodiil yet,\"" she frowned. \""In my culture, you proved your worth, not just expected it.  My parents both were great warriors, as I hope to be.\""""},{""text1"":""Her eyes went out to the lawn, to the statues.""},{""text1"":""\""Do the sculptures represent your parents?\""""},{""text1"":""\""That's my father Pariom there,\"" she said gesturing to a life-sized representation of a massively built man, unashamedly naked, gripping another warrior by the throat and preparing to decapitate him with an outstretched blade.  It was clearly a realistic depiction.  Pariom's face was plain, even slightly ugly with a low forehead, a mass of tangled hair, stubble on his cheeks.  Even a slight gap in his teeth, which no sculptor would surely have invented except to do justice to his model's true idiosyncrasies.""},{""text1"":""\""And your mother?\"" I asked, pointing to a nearby statue of a proud, rather squat warrior woman in a mantilla and scarf, holding a child.""},{""text1"":""\""Oh no,\"" she laughed. \""That was my uncle's old nurse.  Mother's statue still has a sheet over it.\""""},{""text1"":""I don't know what prompted me to insist that we unveil the statue that she pointed to.  In all likelihood, it was nothing but fate, and a selfish desire to continue the conversation.   I was afraid that if I did not give her a project, she would feel the need to return to the party, and I would be alone again.  At first she was reluctant.  She had not yet made up her mind whether the statues would suffer in the wet, sometimes cold Cyrodilic climate.  Perhaps all should be covered, she reasoned.  It may be that she was merely making conversation, and was reluctant as I was to end the stand-off and be that much closer to having to return to the party.""},{""text1"":""In a few minutes time, we tore the tarp from the statue of Betaniqi's mother.  That is when my life changed forevermore.""},{""text1"":""She was an untamed spirit of nature, screaming in a struggle with a misshapen monstrous figure in black marble.  Her gorgeous, long fingers were raking across the creature's face.  The monster's talons gripped her right breast in a sort of caress that prefaces a mortal wound.  Its legs and hers wound around one another in a battle that was a dance.  I felt annihilated.  This lithe but formidable woman was beautiful beyond all superficial standards.  Whoever had sculpted it had somehow captured not only a face and figure of a goddess, but her power and will.  She was both tragic and triumphant.  I fell instantly and fatally in love with her.""},{""text1"":""I had not even noticed when Gelyn, one of my fellow initiates who was leaving the party, came up behind us.  Apparently I had whispered the word \""magnificent,\"" because I heard Betaniqi reply as if miles away, \""Yes, it is magnificent.  That's why I was afraid of exposing it to the elements.\""""},{""text1"":""Then I heard, clearly, like a stone breaking water, Gelyn: \""Mara preserve me.  That must be Palla.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Then you heard of my mother?\"" asked Betaniqi, turning his way.""},{""text1"":""\""I hail from Wayrest, practically on the border to Hammerfell.  I don't think there's anyone who hasn't heard of your mother and her great heroism, ridding the land of that abominable beast.  She died in that struggle, didn't she?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Yes,\"" said the girl sadly. \""But so too did the creature.\""""},{""text1"":""For a moment, we were all silent.  I don't remember anything more of that night.  Somehow I knew I was invited to dine the next evening, but my mind and heart had been entirely and forever more arrested by the statue.  I returned back to the Guild, but my dreams were fevered and brought me no rest.  Everything seemed diffused by white light, except for one beautiful, fearsome woman.""},{""text1"":""Palla.""},{""text1"":""Palla\nBook II""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""by\nVojne Mierstyyd""},{""text1"":""\nPalla.  Pal La.  The name burned in my heart.  I found myself whispering it in my studies even when I tried to concentrate on something the Magister was saying.  My lips would silently purse to voice the \""Pal,\"" and tongue lightly flick to form the \""La\"" as if I were kissing her spirit before me.  It was madness in every way except that I knew that it was madness.  I knew I was in love.  I knew she was a noble Redguard woman, a fierce warrior more beautiful than the stars.  I knew her young daughter Betaniqi had taken possession of a manorhouse near the Guild, and that she liked me, perhaps was even infatuated.  I knew Palla had fought a terrible beast and killed it.  I knew Palla was dead.""},{""text1"":""As I say, I knew it was madness, and by that, I knew I could not be mad.  But I also knew that I must return to Betaniqi's palace to see her statue of my beloved Palla engaged in that final, horrible, fatal battle with the monster.""},{""text1"":""Return I did, over and over again.  Had Betaniqi been a different sort of noblewoman, more comfortable with her peers, I would not have had so many opportunities.  In her innocence, unaware of my sick obsession, she welcomed my company.  We would talk for hours, laughing, and every time we would take a walk to the reflecting pond where I would always stop breathless before the sculpture of her mother.""},{""text1"":""\""It's a marvelous tradition you have, preserving these figures of your ancestors at their finest moments,\"" I said, feeling her curious eyes on me. \""And the craftsmanship is without parallel.\""""},{""text1"":""\""You wouldn't believe me,\"" laughed the girl. \""But it was a bit of scandal when my great grandfather began the custom.  We Redguards hold a great reverence for our families, but we are warriors, not artists.  He hired an traveling artist to create the first statues, and everyone admired them until it was revealed that the artist was an elf.  An Altmer from the Summurset Isle.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Scandal!\""""},{""text1"":""\""It was, absolutely,\"" Betaniqi nodded seriously. \""The idea that a pompous, wicked elf's hands had formed these figures of noble Redguard warriors was unthinkable, profane, irreverent, everything bad you can imagine.  But my great grandfather's heart was in the beauty of it, and his philosophy of using the best to honor the best passed down to us all.  I would not have even considered having a lesser artist create the statues of my parents, even if it would have been more allegiant to my culture.\""""},{""text1"":""\""They're all exquisite,\"" I said.""},{""text1"":""\""But you like the one of my mother most of all,\"" she smiled. \""I see you look at it even when you seem to be looking at the others.  It's my favorite also.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Would you tell me more about her?\"" I asked, trying to keep my voice light and conversational.""},{""text1"":""\""Oh, she would have said she was nothing extraordinary, but she was,\"" the girl said, picking a flower from the garden. \""My father died when I was quite young, and she had so many roles to fill, but she did them all effortlessly.  We have a great many business interests and she was brilliant at managing everything.  Certainly better than I am now.  All it took was her smile and everyone obeyed, and those that didn't paid dearly.  She was very witty and charming, but a formidable force when the need arose for her to fight.  Hundreds of battles, but I can never remember a moment of feeling neglected or unloved.  I literally thought she was too strong for death.   Stupid, I know, but when she went to battle that -- that horrible creature, that freak from a mad wizard's laboratory, I never even thought she would not return.  She was kind to her friends and ruthless to her enemies.  What more can one say about a woman than that?\""""},{""text1"":""Poor Betaniqi's eyes teared up with remembrance.  What sort of villain was I to goad her so, in order to satisfy my perverted longings?  Sheogorath could never have conflicted a mortal man more than me.  I found myself both weeping and filled with desire.  Palla not only looked like a goddess, but from her daughter's story, she was one.""},{""text1"":""That night while undressing for bed, I rediscovered the black disc I had stolen from Magister Tendixus's office weeks before.  I had half-forgotten about its existence, that mysterious necromantic artifact which the mage believed could resurrect a dead love.  Almost by pure instinct, I found myself placing the disc on my heart and whispering, \""Palla.\""""},{""text1"":""A momentary chill filled my chamber.  My breath hung in the air in a mist before dissipating.  Frightened I dropped the disc.  It took a moment before my reason returned, and with it the inescapable conclusion: the artifact could fulfill my desire.""},{""text1"":""Until the early morning hours, I tried to raise my mistress from the chains of Oblivion, but it was no use.  I was no necromancer.  I entertained thoughts of how to ask one of the Magisters to help me, but I remembered how Magister Ilther had bid me to destroy it.  They would expel me from the Guild if I went to them and destroy the disc themselves.  And with it, my only key to bringing my love to me.""},{""text1"":""I was in my usual semi-torpid condition the next day in classes.  Magister Ilther himself was lecturing on his specialty, the School of Enchantment.  He was a dull speaker with a monotone voice, but suddenly I felt as if every shadow had left the room and I was in a palace of light.""},{""text1"":""\""When most persons think of my particular science, they think of the process of invention.  The infusing of charms and spells into objects.  The creation of a magickal blade, perhaps, or a ring.  But the skilled enchanter is also a catalyst.  The same mind that can create something new can also provoke greater power from something old.  A ring that can generate warmth for a novice, on the hand of such a talent can bake a forest black.\"" The fat man chuckled: \""Not that I'm advocating that.  Leave that for the School of Destruction.\""""},{""text1"":""That week all the initiates were asked to choose a field of specialization.  All were surprised when I turned my back on my old darling, the School of Illusion.  It seemed ridiculous to me that I had ever entertained an affection for such superficial charms.  All my intellect was now focused on the School of Enchantment, the means by which I could free the power of the disc.""},{""text1"":""For months thereafter, I barely slept.  A few hours a week, I'd spend with Betaniqi and my statue to give myself strength and inspiration.  All the rest of my time was spent with Magister Ilther or his assistants, learning everything I could about enchantment.  They taught me how to taste the deepest levels of magicka within a stored object.""},{""text1"":""\""A simple spell cast once, no matter how skillfully and no matter how spectacularly, is ephemeral, of the present, what it is and no more,\"" sighed Magister Ilther. \""But placed in a home, it develops into an almost living energy, maturing and ripening so only its surface is touched when an unskilled hand wields it.  You must consider yourself a miner, digging deeper to pull forth the very heart of gold.\""""},{""text1"":""Every night when the laboratory closed, I practiced what I had learned.  I could feel my power grow and with it, the power of the disc.  Whispering \""Palla,\"" I delved into the artifact, feeling every slight nick that marked the runes and every facet of the gemstones.  At times I was so close to her, I felt hands touching mine.  But something dark and bestial, the reality of death I suppose, would always break across the dawning of my dream.  With it came an overwhelming rotting odor, which the initiates in the chambers next to mine began to complain about.""},{""text1"":""\""Something must have crawled into the floorboards and died,\"" I offered lamely.""},{""text1"":""Magister Ilther praised my scholarship, and allowed me the use of his laboratory after hours to further my studies.  Yet no matter what I learned, Palla seemed scarcely closer.  One night, it all ended.  I was swaying in a deep ecstasy, moaning her name, the disc bruising my chest, when a sudden lightning flash through the window broke my concentration.  A tempest of furious rain roared over Mir Corrup.  I went to close the shutters, and when I returned to my table, I found that the disc had shattered.""},{""text1"":""I broke into hysterical sobs and then laughter.  It was too much for my fragile mind to bear such a loss after so much time and study.  The next day and the day after, I spent in my bed, burning with a fever.  Had I not been a Mages Guild with so many healers, I likely would have died.  As it was, I provided an excellent study for the budding young scholars.""},{""text1"":""When at last I was well enough to walk, I went to visit Betaniqi.  She was charming as always, never once commenting on my appearance, which must have been ghastly.  Finally I gave her reason to worry when I politely but firmly declined to walk with her along the reflecting pool.""},{""text1"":""\""But you love looking at the statuary,\"" she exclaimed.""},{""text1"":""I felt that I owed her the truth and much more. \""Dear lady, I love more than the statuary.  I love your mother.  She is all I've been able to think about for months now, ever since you and I first removed the tarp from that blessed sculpture.  I don't know what you think of me now, but I have been obsessed with learning how to bring her back from the dead.\""""},{""text1"":""Betaniqi stared at me, eyes wide.  Finally she spoke: \""I think you need to leave now.  I don't know if this is a terrible jest --\""""},{""text1"":""\""Believe me, I wish it were.  You see, I failed.  I don't know why.  It could not have been that my love wasn't strong enough, because no man had a stronger love.  Perhaps my skills as an enchanter are not masterful, but it wasn't from lack of study!\"" I could feel my voice rise and knew I was beginning to rant, but I could not hold back. \""Perhaps the fault lay in that your mother never met me, but I think that only the caster's love is taken into account in the necromantic spell. I don't know what it was!  Maybe that horrible creature, the monster that killed her, cast some sort of curse on her with its dying breath!  I failed!  And I don't know why!\""""},{""text1"":""With a surprising burst of speed and strength for so small a lady, Betaniqi shoved herself against me.  She screamed, \""Get out!\"" and I fled out the door.""},{""text1"":""Before she slammed the door shut, I offered my pathetic apologies: \""I'm so sorry, Betaniqi, but consider that I wanted to bring your mother back to you.  It's madness, I know, but there is only one thing that's certain in my life and that's that I love Palla.\""""},{""text1"":""The door was nearly shut, but the girl opened it crack to ask tremulously: \""You love whom?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Palla!\"" I cried to the Gods.""},{""text1"":""\""My mother,\"" she whispered angrily. \""Was named Xarlys.  Palla was the monster.\""""},{""text1"":""I stared at the closed door for Mara knows how much time, and then began the long walk back to the Mages Guild.  My memory searched through the minutiae to the Tales and Tallows night so long ago when I first beheld the statue, and first heard the name of my love.  That Breton initiate, Gelyn had spoken.  He was behind me.  Was he recognizing the beast and not the lady?""},{""text1"":""I turned the lonely bend that intersected with the outskirts of Mir Corrup, and a large shadow rose from the ground where it had been sitting, waiting for me.""},{""text1"":""\""Palla,\"" I groaned. \""Pal La.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Kiss me,\"" it howled.""},{""text1"":""And that brings my story up to the present moment.

One of his commanding officers, Beatia of Ylliolos, had been surprised in an ambush while returning from a meeting with the Emperor.  She and her personal guard of five soldiers barely escaped, and were separated from their army.  They fled across the desolate, sleet-painted rocky cliffs by foot.  The attack had been so sudden, they had not even the time to don armor or get to their horses.""},{""text1"":""\""If we can get to the Gorvigh Ridge,\"" hollered Lieutenant Ascutus, gesturing toward a peak off in the mist, his voice barely discernible over the wind. \""We can meet the legion you stationed in Porhnak.\""""},{""text1"":""Beatia looked across the craggy landscape, through the windswept hoary trees, and shook her head: \""Not that way.  We'll be struck down before we make it halfway to the mountain.  You can see their horses' breath through the trees.\""""},{""text1"":""She directed her guard toward a ruined old keep on the frozen isthmus of Nerone, across the bay from Gorvigh Ridge.  Jutting out on a promontory of rock, it was like many other abandoned castles in northern Skyrim, remnants of Reman Cyrodiil's protective shield against the continent of Akavir.  As they reached their destination and made a fire, they could hear the army of the warchiefs of Danstrar behind them, making camp on the land southwest, blocking the only escape but the sea.  The soldiers assessed the stock of the keep while Beatia looked out to the fog-veiled water through the casements of the ruin.""},{""text1"":""She threw a stone, watching it skip across the ice trailing puffs of mist before it disappeared with a splash into a crack in the surface.""},{""text1"":""\""No food or weaponry to be found, commander,\"" Lieutenant Ascutus reported. \""There's a pile of armor in storage, but it's definitely taken on the elements over the years.  I don't know if it's salvageable at all.\""""},{""text1"":""\""We won't last long here,\"" Beatia replied. \""The Nords know that we'll be vulnerable when night falls, and this old rock won't hold them off.  If there's anything in the keep we can use, find it.  We have to make it across the ice floe to the Ridge.\""""},{""text1"":""After a few minutes of searching and matching pieces, the guards presented two very grimy, scuffed and cracked suits of chitin armor.  Even the least proud of the adventurers and pirates who had looted the castle over the years had thought the shells of chitin beneath their notice.  The soldiers did not dare to clean them: the dust looked to be the only adhesive holding them together.""},{""text1"":""\""They won't offer us much protection, just slow us down,\"" grimaced Ascutus. \""If we run across the ice as soon as it gets dark--\""""},{""text1"":""\""Anyone who can plan and execute an ambush like the warchiefs of Danstrar will be expecting that.  We need to move quickly, now, before they're any closer.\""  Beatia drew a map of the bay in the dust, and then a semicircular path across the water, an arc stretching from the castle to the Gorvigh Ridge. \""The men should go the long way across the bay like so.  The ice is thick there a ways from the shoreline, and there are a lot of rocks for cover.\""""},{""text1"":""\""You're not staying behind to hold the castle!\""""},{""text1"":""\""Of course not,\"" Beatia shook her head and drew a straight line from the castle to the closest shore across the Bay. \""I'll take one of the chitin suits, and try to cross the water here.  If you don't see or hear me when you've made it to land, don't wait -- just get to Porhnak.\""""},{""text1"":""Lieutenant Ascutus tried to dissuade his commander, but he knew that she was would never order one of her men to perform the suicidal act of diversion, that all would die before they reached Gorvigh Ridge if the warlords' army was not distracted.  He could find only one way to honor his duty to protect his commanding officer.  It was not easy convincing Commander Beatia that he should accompany her, but at last, she relented.""},{""text1"":""The sun hung low but still cast a diffused glow, illuminating the snow with a ghostly light, when the five men and one woman slipped through the boulders beneath the castle to the water's frozen edge.  Beatia and Ascutus moved carefully and precisely, painfully aware of each dull crunch of chitin against stone.  At their commander's signal, the four unarmored men dashed towards the north across the ice.""},{""text1"":""When her men had reached the first fragment of cover, a spiral of stone jutting a few yards from the base of the promontory, Beatia turned to listen for the sound of the army above.  Nothing but silence.  They were still unseen.  Ascutus nodded, his eyes through the helm showing no fear.  The commander and her lieutenant stepped onto the ice and began to run.""},{""text1"":""When Beatia had surveyed the bay from the castle ramparts, the crossing closest to shore had seemed like a vast, featureless plane of white.  Now that she was down on the ice, it was even more flat and stark: the sheet of mist rose only up their ankles, but it billowed up at their approach like the hand of nature itself was pointing out their presence to their enemies.  They were utterly exposed.  It came almost as a relief when Beatia heard one of the warchiefs' scouts whistle a signal to his masters.""},{""text1"":""They didn't have to turn around to see if the army was coming.  The sound of galloping hoofs and the crash of trees giving way was very clear over the whistling wind.""},{""text1"":""Beatia wished she could risk a glance to the north to see if her men were hidden from view, but she didn't dare.  She could hear Ascutus running to her right, keeping pace, breathing hard.  He was used to wearing heavier armor, but the chitin joints were so brittle and tight from years of disuse, it was all he could do to bend them.""},{""text1"":""The rocky shore to the Ridge still looked at eternity away when Beatia felt and heard the first volley of arrows.  Most struck the ice at their feet with sharp cracking sounds, but a few nearly found home, ricocheting off their backs.  She silently offered a prayer of thanks to whatever anonymous shellsmith, now long dead, had crafted the armor.  They continued to run, as the first rain of arrows was quickly followed by a second and a third.""},{""text1"":""\n\""Thank Stendarr,\"" Ascutus gasped. \""If there was only leather in the keep, we'd be pierced through and through.  Now if only it weren't... so rigid...\""""},{""text1"":""Beatia felt her own armor joints begin to set, her knees and hips finding more and more resistance with every step. There could be no denying it: they were drawing closer toward the shore, but they were running much more slowly.  She heard the first dreadful galloping crunch of the army charging across the floe toward them.  The riders were cautious on the slippery ice, not driving their horses at full speed, but Beatia knew that they would be upon the two of them soon.""},{""text1"":""The old chitin armor could withstand the bite of a few arrows, but not a lance driven with the force of a galloping horse.  The only great unknown was time.""},{""text1"":""The thunder of beating hooves was deafening behind them when Ascutus and Beatia reached the edge of the shore.  The giant, jagged stones that strung around the beach blockaded the approach.  Beneath their feet, the ice sighed and crackled.  They could not stand still, run forward, nor run back.  Straining against the tired metal in the armor joints, they took two bounds forward and flew at the boulders.""},{""text1"":""The first landing on the ice sounded an explosive crack.  When they rose for the final jump, it was on a wave of water so cold it felt like fire through the thin armor.  Ascutus's right hand found purchase in a deep fissure.  Beatia gripped with both hands, but her boulder was slick with frost.  Faces pressed to the stone, they could not turn to face the army behind them.""},{""text1"":""But they heard the ice splintering, and the soldiers cry out in terror for just an instant.  Then there was no sound but the whining of the wind and the purring lap of the water.  A moment later, there were footsteps on the cliff above.""},{""text1"":""The four guardsmen had crossed the bay.  There were two to pull Beatia up from the face of the boulder, and another two for Ascutus.  They strained and swore at the weight, but finally they had their commander and her lieutenant safely on the edge of Gorvigh Ridge.""},{""text1"":""\""By Mara, that's heavy for light armor.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Yes,\"" smiled Beatia wearily, looking back over the empty broken ice floe, the cracks radiating from the parallel paths she and Ascutus had run. \""But sometimes that's good.\""\n ""}]"

He was a miner, as was his father before him, a common laborer in the mines of the Lord of Mournhold, for his ability in magicka was small. The work was honorable but paid poorly. His mother made and sold comberry cakes at the city market to help eke out their living. They did well enough, she said, they had enough to fill their bellies, no one could wear more than one suit of clothing at a time, and the roof leaked only when it rained. But Symmachus would have liked more. He hoped for a lucky strike at the mines, which would garner him a large bonus. In his free hours he enjoyed hoisting a mug of ale in the tavern with his friends, and gambling with them at cards. He also drew the eyes and sighs of more than one pretty Elven lass, although none held his interest for long. He was a typical young Dark Elf of peasant descent, remarkable only for his size. It was rumored that he had a bit of Nordic blood in him.""},{""text"":""In Symmachus' thirtieth year, there was great rejoicing in Mournhold-a girl-child had been born to the Lord and Lady. A Queen, the people sang, a Queen is born to us! For among the people of Mournhold, the birth of an heiress is a sure sign of future peace and prosperity.""},{""text"":""When the time came round for the royal child's Rite of Naming, the mines were closed and Symmachus dashed home to bathe and dress in his best. \""I'll rush straight home and tell you all about it,\"" he promised his mother, who would not be able to attend. She had been ailing, and besides there would be a great crush of people as all Mournhold turned out to be part of the blessed event; and being blind she would be unable to see anything anyway.""},{""text"":""\""My son,\"" she said. \""Afore you go, fetch me a priest or a healer, else I may pass from the mortal plane ere you return.\""""},{""text"":""Symmachus crossed to her pallet at once and noted anxiously that her forehead was very hot and her breathing shallow. He pried loose a slat of the wooden floor under which their small hoard of savings was kept. There wasn't nearly enough to pay a priest for healing.

Symmachus snatched up his cloak and hurried away.""},{""text"":""The streets were full of folk hurrying to the sacred grove, but the temples were locked and barred. \""Closed for the ceremony,\"" read all the signs.""},{""text"":""Symmachus elbowed his way through the mob and managed to overtake a brown-robed priest. \""After the rite, brother,\"" the priest said, \""if you have gold I shall gladly attend to your mother.

Other, less desirable Dark Elven traits evidently included pilfering, lying, and a little misplaced magic, just a small fire spell here and a little levitation spell there. And, as she grew older, a keen interest in boys and men, who could provide very pleasant sensations -- and to her astonishment, gifts as well. Inga disapproved of this last for reasons incomprehensible to Barenziah, so she was careful to keep it as secret as possible.""},{""text"":""\""She's wonderful with the children,\"" Inga added, referring to her five sons, all younger than Barenziah. \""I don't think she'd ever let them come to harm.\"" A tutor had been hired when Jonni was six and Barenziah eight, and they took their lessons together. She would have liked to train in arms as well, but the very idea scandalized Count Sven and Lady Inga. So Barenziah was given a small bow and allowed to play at target shooting with the boys. She watched them at arms practice when she could, sparred with them when no grownup folk were about, and knew she was good as or better than they.""},{""text"":""\""She's very... proud, though, isn't she?\"" one of the ladies would whisper to Inga; and Barenziah, pretending not to hear, would nod silently in agreement. She could not help but feel superior to the Count and his Lady. There was something about them that provoked contempt.""},{""text"":""Afterward she came to learn that Sven and Inga were distant cousins of Darkmoor Keep's last titled residents, and she finally understood. They were poseurs, impostors, not rulers at all. At least, they were not raised to rule. This thought made her strangely furious at them, a good clean hatred quite detached from resentment. She came to see them as disgusting and repellent insects who could be despised but never feared.""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":""Once a month a courier came from the Emperor, bringing a small bag of gold for Sven and Inga and a large bag of dried mushrooms from Morrowind for Barenziah, her favorite treat. On these occasions, she was always made to look presentable-or at least as presentable as a skinny Dark Elf could be made to look in Inga's eyes-before being summoned into the courier's presence for a brief interview. The same courier seldom came twice, but all of them looked her over in much the same way a farmer would look over a hog he is readying for market.""},{""text"":""In the spring of her sixteenth year, Barenziah thought the courier looked as if she were at last ready for market. Upon reflection, she decided she did not wish to be marketed. The stable-boy, Straw, a big, muscular blond lad, clumsy, gentle, affectionate, and rather simple, had been urging her to run off for some weeks now. Barenziah stole the bag of gold the courier had left, took the mushrooms from the storeroom, disguised herself as a boy in one of Jonni's old tunics and a pair of his cast-off breeches... and on one fine spring night she and Straw took the two best horses from the stable and rode hard through the night toward Whiterun, the nearest city of any importance and the place where Straw wanted to be. But Mournhold and Morrowind also lay eastward and they drew Barenziah as a lodestone draws iron.""},{""text"":""In the morning they abandoned the horses at Barenziah's insistence. She knew they would be missed and tracked down, and she hoped to throw off any pursuers.""},{""text"":""They continued on foot until late afternoon, keeping to side roads, and slept for several hours in an abandoned hut. They went on at dusk and came to Whiterun's city gates just before dawn. Barenziah had prepared a pass of sorts for Straw, a makeshift document stating an errand to a temple in the city for a local village lord. She herself glided over the wall with the help of a levitation spell. She had reasoned-correctly, as it turned out-that by now the gate guards would have been alerted to keep an eye out for a young Dark Elven girl and a Nordic boy traveling together. On the other hand, unaccompanied country yokels like Straw were a common enough sight. Alone and with papers, it was unlikely that he would draw attention.""},{""text"":""Her simple plan went smoothly. She met Straw at the temple, which was not far from the gate; she had been to Whiterun on a few previous occasions. Straw, however, had never been more than a few miles from Sven's estate, which was his birthplace.""},{""text"":""Together they made their way to a rundown inn in the poorer quarters of Whiterun. Gloved, cloaked, and hooded against the morning chill, Barenziah's dark skin and red eyes were not apparent and no one paid any heed to them. They entered the inn separately. Straw paid the innkeeper for a single cubicle, an immense meal, and two jugs of ale. Barenziah sneaked in a few minutes later.""},{""text"":""They ate and drank together gleefully, rejoicing in their escape, and made love vigorously on the narrow cot. Afterward they fell into an exhausted, dreamless sleep.""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":""They stayed for a week at Whiterun. Straw earned a bit of money running errands and Barenziah burgled a few houses at night. She continued to dress as a boy. She cut her hair short and dyed her flame-red tresses jet black to further the disguise, and kept out of sight as much as possible. There were few Dark Elves in Whiterun.""},{""text"":""One day Straw got them work as temporary guards for a merchant caravan traveling east. The one-armed sergeant looked her over dubiously.""},{""text"":""\""Heh,\"" he chuckled, \""Dark Elf, ain'tcha? Like settin' a wolf t'guard the sheep, that is. Still, I need arms, and we ain't goin' near 'nough Morrowind so's ye can betray us to yer folk. Our homegrown bandits would as fain cut yer throat as mine.\""""},{""text"":""The sergeant turned to give Straw an appraising look. Then he spun back abruptly toward Barenziah, whipping out his shortsword. But she had her dagger out in the twinkling of an eye and was in a defensive stance. Straw drew his own knife and circled round to the man's rear. The sergeant dropped his blade and chuckled again.""},{""text"":""\""Not bad, kids, not bad. How are ye with yon bow, Dark Elf?\"" Barenziah demonstrated her prowess briefly. \""Aye, not bad, not bad 'tall. And ye'll be keen of eye by night, boy, and of hearin' 'tall times. A trusty Dark Elf makes as good a fightin' man as any could ask for. I know. I served under Symmachus hisself afore I lost this arm and got invalided outter the Emp'ror's army.\""""},{""text"":""\""We could betray them. I know folk who'd pay well,\"" Straw said later as they bedded down for their last night at the ramshackle lodge. \""Or rob them ourselves. They're very rich, those merchants are, Berry.\""""},{""text"":""Barenziah laughed. \""Whatever would we do with so much money? And besides, we need their protection for traveling quite as much as they need ours.\""""},{""text"":""\""We could buy a little farm, you and me, Berry -- and settle down, all nice like.\""""},{""text"":""Peasant! Barenziah thought scornfully. Straw was a peasant and harbored nothing but peasant dreams. But all she said was, \""Not here, Straw, we're too close to Darkmoor still. We'll have other chances farther east.\""""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":""The caravan went only as far east as Sunguard. The Emperor Tiber Septim I had done much in the way of building relatively safe and regularly patrolled highways. But the tolls were steep, and this particular caravan kept to the side roads as much as possible to avoid them. This exposed them to the hazards of wayside robbers, both human and Orcish, and roving brigand bands of various races. But such were the perils of trade and profit.""},{""text"":""They had two such encounters before reaching Sunguard -- an ambush which Barenziah's keen ears warned them of in plenty of time for them to circle about and surprise the lurkers, and a night attack by a mixed band of Khajiit, humans, and Wood Elves. The latter were a skilled band and even Barenziah did not hear them sneaking up in time to give much warning. This time the fighting was fierce. The attackers were driven off, but two of the caravan's other guards were slain and Straw got a nasty cut on his thigh before he and Barenziah managed to gash his Khajiit assailant's throat.""},{""text"":""Barenziah rather enjoyed the life. The garrulous sergeant had taken a liking to her, and she spent most of her evenings sitting around the campfire listening to his tales of campaigning in Morrowind with Tiber Septim and General Symmachus. This Symmachus had been made general after Mournhold fell, the sergeant said. \""He's a fine soldier, boy, Symmachus is. But there was more'n soldiery involved'n that Morrowind business, if y'take my meanin'. But, well, y'know all 'bout that, I 'spect.\""""},{""text"":""\""No. No, I don't remember,\"" Barenziah said, trying to sound nonchalant. \""I've lived most of my life in Skyrim. My mother married a Skyrim man. They're both dead, though. Tell me, what happened to the Lord and Lady of Mournhold?\""""},{""text"":""The sergeant shrugged. \""I ain't never heard. Dead, I 'spect. 'Twas a lot of fightin' afore the Armistice got signed. It's pretty quiet now. Maybe too quiet. Like a calm afore a storm. Say, boy, you goin' back there?\""""},{""text"":""\""Maybe,\"" Barenziah said. The truth was that she was drawn irresistibly to Morrowind, and Mournhold, like a moth to a burning house. Straw sensed it and was unhappy about it. He was unhappy anyway since they could not bed together, as she was supposed to be a boy. Barenziah rather missed it too, but not as much as Straw did, seemingly.""},{""text"":""The sergeant wanted them to sign on for the return trip, but gave them a bonus nonetheless when they turned the offer down, and parchments of recommendation.""},{""text"":""Straw wanted to settle down permanently near Sunguard, but Barenziah insisted on continuing their travels east. \""I'm the Queen of Mournhold by rights,\"" she said, unsure whether it was true -- or was it just a daydream she had made up as a lost, bewildered child? \""I want to go home. I need to go home.\"" That at least was true.""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":""After a few weeks they managed to get places in another caravan heading east. By early winter they were at Riften, and nearing the Morrowind border. But the weather had grown severe as the days passed and they were told no merchant caravans would be setting forth till mid-spring.""},{""text"":""Barenziah stood on top of the city walls and stared across the deep gorge that separated Riften from the snow-clad mountain wall guarding Morrowind beyond.""},{""text"":""\""Berry,\"" Straw said gently. \""Mournhold's a long way off yet, nearly as far as we've come already. And the lands between are wild, full of wolves and bandits and Orcs and still worse creatures. We'll have to wait for spring.\""""},{""text"":""\""There's Silgrod Tower,\"" Berry said, referring to the Dark Elven township that had grown up around an ancient minaret guarding the border between Skyrim and Morrowind.""},{""text"":""\""The bridge guards won't let me across, Berry. They're crack Imperial troops. They can't be bribed. If you go, you go alone. I won't try and stop you. But what will you do? Silgrod Tower is full of Imperial soldiers. Will you become a washing-woman for them? Or a camp follower?\""""},{""text"":""\""No,\"" Barenziah said slowly, thoughtfully. Actually the idea was not entirely unappealing. She was sure she could earn a modest living by sleeping with the soldiers. She'd had a few adventures of that sort as they crossed Skyrim, when she'd dressed as a woman and slipped away from Straw. She'd only been looking for a bit of variety. Straw was sweet but dull. She'd been startled, but extremely pleased, when the men she picked up offered her money afterward. Straw had been unhappy about it, though, and would shout for a while then sulk for days afterward if he caught her at it. He was quite jealous. He'd even threatened to leave her. Not that he ever did. Or could.""},{""text"":""But the Imperial Guards were a tough and brutal lot by all accounts, and Barenziah had heard some very ugly stories during their treks. The ugliest of them by far had come from the lips of ex-army veterans around the caravan campfire, and were proudly recounted. They'd been trying to shock her and Straw, she realized-but she also comprehended that there was some truth behind the wild tales. Straw hated that kind of dirty talk, and hated it more that she had to hear it. But there was a part of him that was fascinated nevertheless.""},{""text"":""Barenziah sensed this and had encouraged Straw to seek out other women. But he said he didn't want anyone else but her. She told him candidly she didn't feel that way about him, but she did like him better than anyone else. \""Then why do you go with other men?\"" Straw had asked on one occasion.""},{""text"":""\""I don't know.\""""},{""text"":""Straw sighed. \""They say Dark Elven women are like that.\""""},{""text"":""Barenziah smiled and shrugged. \""I don't know.

Yes, I do know.\"" She turned and kissed him affectionately. \""I guess that's all the explanation there is.\""""},{""text"":""The Real Barenziah, v2""},{""text"":""Barenziah and Straw settled into Rifton for the winter, taking a cheap room in the slummier section of town. Barenziah wanted to join the Thieves Guild, knowing there would be trouble if she were caught freelancing. One day in a barroom she caught the eye of a known member of the Guild, a bold young Khajiit named Therris. She offered to bed him if he would sponsor her membership. He looked her over, grinning, and agreed, but said she'd still have to pass an initiation.""},{""text"":""\""What sort of initiation?\""""},{""text"":""\""Ah,\"" Therris said. \""Pay up first, sweetness.\""""},{""text"":""[This passage has been censored by order of the Temple.]""},{""text"":""Straw was going to kill her, and maybe Therris too. What in Tamriel had possessed her to do such a thing? She cast an apprehensive look around the room, but the other patrons had lost interest and gone back to their own business. She did not recognize any of them; this wasn't the inn where she and Straw were staying. With luck it'd be a while, or never, before Straw found out.""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":""Therris was by far the most exciting and attractive man she had yet met. He not only told her about the skills she needed to become a member of the Thieves Guild, but also trained her in them himself or else introduced her to people who could.""},{""text"":""Among these was a woman who knew something about magic. Katisha was a plump and matronly Nord. She was married to a smith, had two teenage children, and was perfectly ordinary and respectable--except that she was very fond of cats (and by logical inference, their humanoid counterparts the Khajiit), had a talent for certain kinds of magic, and cultivated rather odd friends. She taught Barenziah an invisibility spell and schooled her in other forms of stealth and disguise. Katisha mingled magical and non-magical talents freely, using one set to enhance the other. She was not a member of the Thieves Guild but was fond of Therris in a motherly sort of way. Barenziah warmed to her as she never had toward any woman, and over the next few weeks she told Katisha all about herself.""},{""text"":""She brought Straw there too sometimes. Straw approved of Katisha. But not of Therris. Therris found Straw \""interesting\"" and suggested to Barenziah that they arrange what he called a \""threesome.\""""},{""text"":""\""Absolutely not,\"" Barenziah said firmly, grateful that Therris had broached the subject in private for once. \""He wouldn't like it. I wouldn't like it!\""""},{""text"":""Therris smiled his charming, triangular feline smile and sprawled lazily on his chair, stretching his limbs and curling his tail. \""You might be surprised. Both of you. Pairing is so boring.\""""},{""text"":""Barenziah answered him with a glare.""},{""text"":""\""Or maybe you wouldn't like it with that country bumpkin of yours, sweetness. Would you mind if I brought along another friend?\""""},{""text"":""\""Yes, I would. If you're bored with me, you and your friend can find someone else.\"" She was a member of the Thieves Guild now. She had passed their initiation. She found Therris useful but not essential. Maybe she was a bit bored with him too.""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":""She talked to Katisha about her problems with men. Or what she thought of as her problems with men.

Prostitutes?\"" she said, although she was dubious.""},{""text"":""\""You mean promiscuous. Although some do become prostitutes, I suppose,\"" Katisha said as an afterthought. \""Elves are promiscuous when they're young. But you'll outgrow it. Perhaps you're beginning to already,\"" she added hopefully. She liked Barenziah, had grown to be quite fond of her. \""You ought to meet some nice Elven boys, though.

Maybe someday. Yes, someday. But not if I can't be queen. And not just any queen. The Queen of Mournhold.\"" She said this determinedly, almost stubbornly, as if to drown out any doubt.""},{""text"":""Katisha chose to ignore this last comment. She was amused at the girl's hyperactive imagination, took it as a sign of a well-functioning mind. \""I think Straw will be a very old man before 'someday' comes, Berry. Elves live for a very long time.\"" Katisha's face briefly wore the envious, wistful look humans got when contemplating the thousand-year lifespan Elves had been granted by the gods. True, few ever actually lived that long as disease and violence took their respective tolls. But they could. And one or two of them actually did.""},{""text"":""\""I like old men too,\"" Berry said.""},{""text"":""Katisha laughed. \nBarenziah fidgeted impatiently while Therris sorted through the papers on the desk. He was being meticulous and methodical, carefully replacing everything just as he'd found it.""},{""text"":""They'd broken into a nobleman's household, leaving Straw to hover outside as lookout. Therris had said it was a simple job but very hush-hush. He hadn't even wanted to bring any other Guild members along. He said he knew he could trust Berry and Straw, but no one else.""},{""text"":""\""Tell me what you're looking for and I'll find it,\"" Berry whispered urgently. Therris' night sight wasn't as good as hers and he didn't want her to magick up even a small orb of light.""},{""text"":""She had never been in such a luxurious place. Not even the Darkmoor castle of Count Sven and Lady Inga where she had spent her childhood compared to it. She'd gazed around in wonder as they made their way through the ornately decorated and hugely echoing downstairs rooms. But Therris didn't seem interested in anything but the desk in the small book-lined study on the upper floor.""},{""text"":""\""Sssst,\"" he hissed angrily.""},{""text"":""\""Someone's coming!\"" Berry said, a moment before the door opened and two dark figures stepped into the room. Therris gave her a violent shove toward them and sprang to the window. Barenziah's muscles went rigid; she couldn't move or even speak. She watched helplessly as one of the figures, the smaller one, leaped after Therris. There were two quick, silent stabs of blue light, then Therris folded over into a still heap.""},{""text"":""Outside the study the house had come alive with hastening footsteps and voices calling out in alarm and the clank of armor hurriedly put on.""},{""text"":""The bigger man, a Dark Elf by the looks of him, half-lifted, half-dragged Therris to the door and thrust him into the waiting arms of another Elf. A jerk of the first Elf's head sent his smaller blue-robed companion after them.

Out of red eyes that seemed strange to her, except in her own seldom-seen reflection.""},{""text"":""\""He's my friend,\"" Barenziah said. The words came out in a tone that sounded dull and hopeless to her own ears. Symmachus!

The tall Elf perched himself on a corner of the desk. He seemed quite relaxed and prepared to stay awhile.""},{""text"":""Then it occurred to her. Several unsuitable friends, had he said? This man knew all about her! Or seemed to know enough, anyway. Which amounted to the same thing. \""W-what's going to happen to them? To m-me?\""""},{""text"":""\""Ah. As you know, this house belongs to the commander of the Imperial troops in this area. Which means to say that it belongs to me.\"" Barenziah gasped and Symmachus looked up sharply. \""What, you didn't know? Tsk, tsk. Why, you are rash, Milady, even for seventeen.

The Thieves Guild would never have attempted a mission that crossed Imperial policy. No one dared oppose Tiber Septim, at least no one she knew of. Someone at the Guild had bungled. Badly. And now she was going to pay for it.""},{""text"":""\""I daresay. It's unlikely that Therris had Guild approval for this. In fact, I wonder--\"" Symmachus examined the desk carefully, pulling out drawers. He selected one, placed it on top of the desk, and removed a false bottom.

I'm to be Queen of Mournhold and you'll be lord of your own farmstead.\"" She took his hand, smiled at him warmly, genuinely. \""I'll write you, Straw. I promise. You must find a scribe so you can write me too.\""""},{""text"":""Straw shook his head sadly. When Barenziah persisted, he opened his mouth and pointed at it, making inarticulate noises.

He could be dangerous. At least he's alive, and he won't need his tongue to ... raise pigs or whatever.\""""},{""text"":""\""I hate you!\"" Barenziah screamed at him, then abruptly doubled over and vomited on the floor. She continued to revile him between intermittent bouts of nausea. He listened stolidly for some time while Drelliane cleaned up after her. Finally, he told her to cease or he would gag her for her journey to the Emperor.""},{""text"":""They stopped at Katisha's house on their way out of the city. Symmachus and Drelliane didn't dismount. All seemed normal but Barenziah was frightened as she knocked on the door. Katisha answered the knock. Barenziah thanked the gods silently that at least she was all right. But she'd also obviously been weeping. In any case, she embraced Barenziah warmly.""},{""text"":""\""Why are you crying?\"" Barenziah asked.""},{""text"":""\""For Therris, of course. You haven't heard? Oh dear. Poor Therris. He's dead.\"" Barenziah felt icy fingers creeping round her heart. \""He was caught stealing from the Commandant's house. Poor fellow, but that was so foolish of him. Oh, Berry, he was drawn and quartered this very dawn by the Commandant's order!\"" She started to sob. \""I went. He asked for me. It was terrible. He suffered so before he died. I'll never forget it. I looked for you and Straw, but no one knew where you'd both gone to.\"" She glanced behind Barenziah. \""That's the Commandant, isn't it? Symmachus.\"" Then Katisha did a strange thing. She stopped crying and grinned. \""You know, the moment I saw him, I thought, This is the one for Barenziah!\"" Katisha took a fold of her apron and wiped it across her eyes. \""I told him about you, you know.\""""},{""text"":""\""Yes,\"" Barenziah said, \""I know.\"" She took Katisha's hands in each of hers and looked at her earnestly. \""Katisha, I love you. I'm going to miss you. But please don't ever tell anyone else anything about me. Ever. Swear you won't. Especially not to Symmachus. And look after Straw for me. Promise me that.\""""},{""text"":""Katisha promised, puzzled though willing. \""Berry, it wasn't somehow because of me that Therris was caught, was it? I never said anything about Therris to ... to ... him.\"" She glanced over at the general.""},{""text"":""Barenziah assured her that it wasn't, that an informant had told the Imperial Guard of Therris' plans. Which was probably a lie, but she could see that Katisha plainly needed some kind of comfort.""},{""text"":""\""Oh, I'm glad of that, if I can be glad of anything just now. I'd hate to think-- But how could I have known?\"" She leaned over and whispered in Barenziah's ear, \""Symmachus is very handsome, don't you think? And so charming.\""""},{""text"":""\""I wouldn't know about that,\"" Barenziah said dryly. \""I haven't really thought about it. There've been other things to think about.\"" She explained hurriedly about being Queen of Mournhold and going to live in the Imperial City for a while. \""He was looking for me, that's all. On orders from the Emperor. I was the object of a quest, nothing more than some sort of... of a... goal. I don't think he thinks of me as a woman at all. He said I didn't look like a boy, though,\"" she added in the face of Katisha's incredulity. Katisha knew that Barenziah evaluated every male she met in terms of sexual desirability, and availability. \""I suppose it's the shock of finding out that I really am a queen,\"" she added, and Katisha agreed that yes, that's true, that must've been something of a shock, although one there was no likelihood of her experiencing firsthand. She smiled. Barenziah smiled with her. Then they hugged again, tearfully, for the last time. She never saw Katisha again. Or Straw. \nThe royal party left Rifton by the great southern gate. Once through, Symmachus tapped her shoulder and pointed back at the portals. \""I thought you might want to say good-bye to Therris too, Your Highness,\"" he said.""},{""text"":""Barenziah stared briefly but steadily at the head impaled on a spike above the gate. The birds had been at it, but the face was still recognizable. \""I don't think he'll hear me, although I'm quite sure he'll be pleased to know I'm fine,\"" she said, seeming to sound light. \""Let's be on our way, General, shall we?\""""},{""text"":""Symmachus was clearly disappointed by her lack of reaction. \""Ai. You heard of this from your friend Katisha, I suppose?\""""},{""text"":""\""You suppose correctly. She attended the execution,\"" Barenziah said casually. If he didn't know already, he'd find out soon enough, she was sure of that.""},{""text"":""\""Did she know Therris belonged to the Guild?\""""},{""text"":""She shrugged. \""Everyone knew that. It's only lower-ranking members like me who are supposed to keep their membership secret. The ones higher up are well known.\"" She turned to smile archly at him. \""But you must know all that, shouldn't you, General?\"" she said sweetly.""},{""text"":""He seemed unaffected by this. \""So you told her who you were and whence you came, but not about the Guild.\""""},{""text"":""\""The Guild membership was not my secret to tell. The other was. There's a difference. Besides, Katisha is a very honest woman. Had I told her, it would have lessened me in her eyes. She was always after Therris to take up a more honest line of work. I value her good opinion.\"" She afforded him a glacial stare. \""Not that it's any concern of yours, but do you know what else she thought? She also thought I'd be happier if I settled down with just one man. One of my own race. One of my own race with all the right qualities. One of my own race with all the right qualities, who knows to say all the right things. You, in fact.\"" She grabbed the reins preparatory to assuming a brisker pace--but not without sinking one final irresistible barb. \""Isn't it odd how wishes come true sometimes--but not in the way you want them to? Or maybe I should say, not in the way you would ever want them to?\""""},{""text"":""His answer so took her by surprise that she quite forgot about cantering off. \""Yes. Very odd,\"" he replied, and his tone matched his words exactly. Then he excused himself and fell behind.""},{""text"":""She held her head high and urged her mount onward, trying to look unimpressed. Now what was it about his response that bothered her? Not what he said. No, that wasn't it. But something about the way he said it. Something about it made her think that she, Barenziah, was one of his wishes that had come true. Unlikely as this seemed, she gave it due deliberation. He had found her at last, after months of searching, it seemed, under pressure from the Emperor, no doubt. So his wish had come true. Yes, that must be it.""},{""text"":""But in a way, apparently, not altogether to his liking.""},{""text"":""The Real Barenziah, v3""},{""text"":""For several days, Barenziah felt a weight of sorrow at her separation from her friends. But by the second week out her spirits began to rise a little. She found that she enjoyed being on the road again, although she missed Straw's companionship more than she would have thought. They were escorted by a troop of Redguard knights with whom she felt comfortable, although these were much more disciplined, and decorous, than the guards of the merchant caravans she had spent time with. They were genial but respectful toward her despite her attempts at flirtation.""},{""text"":""Symmachus scolded her privately, saying a queen must maintain royal dignity at all times.""},{""text"":""\""You mean I'm never to have any fun?\"" she inquired petulantly.""},{""text"":""\""Ai. Not with such as these. They are beneath you. Graciousness is to be desired from those in authority, Milady. Familiarity is not.

Let me remind you, Your Highness, that you hold the throne of Mournhold not by right of blood but solely at the pleasure of Tiber Septim. If he judges you unsuitable, your reign will end ere it begins. He requires intelligence, obedience, discretion, and total loyalty of all his appointees, and he favors chastity and modesty in women. I strongly suggest you model your deportment after our good Drelliane. Milady.\""""},{""text"":""\""I'd as lief be back in Darkmoor!\"" Barenziah snapped resentfully, offended at the thought of emulating the frigid, prudish Drelliane in any way.""},{""text"":""\""That is not an option. Your Highness. If you are of no use to Tiber Septim, he will see to it that you are of no use to his enemies either,\"" the general said portentously. \""If you would keep your head on your shoulders, take heed. Let me add that power offers pleasures other than those of carnality and cavorting with base company.\""""},{""text"":""He began to speak of art, literature, drama, music, and the grand balls thrown at the Imperial Court. Barenziah listened with growing interest, spurred on not entirely by his threats. But afterward she asked timidly if she might continue her study of magic while at the Imperial City. Symmachus seemed pleased at this and promised to arrange it. Encouraged, she then said that she noted three of their knights escort were women, and asked if she might train a little with them, just for the sake of exercise. The general looked less delighted at this, but gave his consent, though stressing it would only be with the women.""},{""text"":""The late winter weather held fair, though slightly frosty, for the rest of their journey so that they traveled quickly over firm roads.

It was a welcome sound.""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":""They came to the great bridge that crossed into the Imperial City at sunset. The rosy glow turned the stark white marble edifices of the metropolis a delicate pink. It all looked very new and grand and immaculate. A broad avenue led north toward the Palace. A crowd of people of all sorts and races filled the wide concourse. Lights winked out in the shops and on in the inns as dusk fell and stars came out singly then by twos and threes. Even the side streets were broad and brightly illuminated. Near the Palace the towers of an immense Mages Guildhall reared toward the east, while westward the stained glass windows of a huge tabernacle glittered in the dying light.""},{""text"":""Symmachus had apartments in a magnificent house two blocks from the palace, past the temple. (\""The Temple of the One,\"" he identified as they passed it, an ancient Nordic cult which Tiber Septim had revived. He said that Barenziah would be expected to become a member should she prove acceptable to the Emperor.) The place was quite splendid--although little to Barenziah's taste. The walls and furnishings were done in utter pristine white, relieved only by touches of dull gold, and the floors in dully gleaming black marble. Barenziah's eyes ached for color and the interplay of subtle shadings.""},{""text"":""In the morning Symmachus and Drelliane escorted her to the Imperial Palace. Barenziah noted that everyone they met greeted Symmachus with a deferential respect in some cases bordering on obsequiousness. The general seemed to take it for granted.""},{""text"":""They were ushered directly into the imperial presence. Morning sun flooded a small room through a large window with tiny panes, washing over a sumptuously laden breakfast table and the single man who sat there, dark against the light. He leapt to his feet as they entered and hurried toward them. \""Ah, Symmachus our most loyal friend, we welcome your return most gladly.\"" His hands held Symmachus' shoulders briefly, fondly, halting the deep genuflection the Dark Elf had been in the process of effecting.""},{""text"":""Barenziah curtseyed as Tiber Septim turned to her.""},{""text"":""\""Barenziah, our naughty little runaway. How do you do, child? Here, let us have a look at you. Why, Symmachus, she's charming, absolutely charming. Why have you hidden her from us all these years? Is the light too much, child? Shall we draw the hangings? Yes, of course.\"" He waved aside Symmachus' protests and drew the curtains himself, not troubling to summon a servant. \""You will pardon us for this discourtesy toward yourselves, our dear guests. We've much to think of, though that's scant excuse for hospitality's neglect. But ah! pray join us. There's some excellent nectarines from Black Marsh.\""""},{""text"":""They settled themselves at the table. Barenziah was dumbfounded. Tiber Septim was nothing like the grim, grey, giant warrior she'd pictured. He was of average height, fully half a head shorter than tall Symmachus, although he was well-knit of figure and lithe of movement. He had a winning smile, bright -- indeed piercing -- blue eyes, and a full head of stark white hair above a lined and weathered face. He might have been any age from forty to sixty. He pressed food and drink upon them, then repeated the question the general had asked her days ago: Why had she left home? Had her guardians been unkind to her?""},{""text"":""\""No, Excellency,\"" Barenziah replied, \""in truth, no -- although I fancied so at times.\"" Symmachus had fabricated a story for her, and Barenziah told it now, although with a certain misgiving. The stable-boy, Straw, had convinced her that her guardians, unable to find a suitable husband for her, meant to sell her off as a concubine in Rihad; and when a Redguard had indeed come, she had panicked and fled with Straw.""},{""text"":""Tiber Septim seemed fascinated and listened raptly as she provided details of her life as a merchant caravan escort. \""Why, 'tis like a ballad!\"" he said. \""By the One, we'll have the Court Bard set it to music. What a charming boy you must have made.\""""},{""text"":""\""General Symmachus said--\"" Barenziah stopped in some confusion, then proceeded. \""He said -- well, that I no longer look much like a boy.

But we pray you remain with us a little longer, that you may prepare yourself for the grave and solemn task with which we shall charge you.\""""},{""text"":""Barenziah gazed at him earnestly, heart beating fast. It was all working just as Symmachus had said it would. She felt a warm flush of gratitude toward him, but was careful to keep her attention focused on the Emperor. \""I am honored, Excellency, and wish most earnestly to serve you and this great Empire you have built in any way I can.\"" It was the politic thing to say, to be sure -- but Barenziah really meant it. She was awed at the magnificence of the city and the discipline and order evident everywhere, and moreover was excited at the prospect of being a part of it all. And she felt quite taken by the gentle Tiber Septim.""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":"" ""},{""text"":""After a few days Symmachus left for Mournhold to take up the duties of a governor until Barenziah was ready to assume the throne, after which he would become her Prime Minister. Barenziah, with Drelliane as chaperone, took up residence in a suite of rooms at the Imperial Palace. Several tutors were provided her, in all the fields deemed seemly for a queenly education. During this time she became deeply interested in the magical arts, but she found the study of history and politics not at all to her preference.""},{""text"":""On occasion she met with Tiber Septim in the Palace gardens and he would unfailingly and politely inquire as to her progress -- and chide her, although with a smile, for her disinterest at matters of state. However, he was always happy to instruct her on the finer points of magic, and he could make even history and politics seem interesting. \""They're people, child, not dry facts in a dusty volume,\"" he said.""},{""text"":""As her understanding broadened, their discussions grew longer, deeper, more frequent. He spoke to her of his vision of a united Tamriel, each race separate and distinct but with shared ideals and goals, all contributing to the common weal. \""Some things are universal, shared by all sentient folk of good will,\"" he said. \""So the One teaches us. We must unite against the malicious and the brutish, the miscreated -- the Orcs, trolls, goblins, and other worse creatures -- and not strive against one another.\"" His blue eyes would light up as he stared into his dream, and Barenziah was delighted just to sit and listen to him. If he drew close to her, the side of her body next to him would glow as if he were a smoldering blaze. If their hands met she would tingle all over as if his body were charged with a shock spell.""},{""text"":""One day, quite unexpectedly, he took her face in his hands and kissed her gently on the mouth. She drew back after a few moments, astonished by the violence of her feelings, and he apologized instantly. \""I... we... we didn't mean to do that. It's just -- you are so beautiful, dear. So very beautiful.\"" He was looking at her with hopeless yearning in his generous eyes.""},{""text"":""She turned away, tears streaming down her face.""},{""text"":""\""Are you angry with us?

I know it's wrong, but I can't help it.\""""},{""text"":""\""We have a consort,\"" he said. \""She is a good and virtuous woman, the mother of our children and future heirs. We could never put her aside -- yet there is nothing between us and her, no sharing of the spirit. She would have us be other than what we are. We are the most powerful person in all of Tamriel, and... Barenziah, we... I... I think I am the most lonely as well.\"" He stood up suddenly. \""Power!\"" he said with sublime contempt. \""I'd trade a goodly share of it for youth and love if the gods would only sanction it.\""""},{""text"":""\""But you are strong and vigorous and vital, more than any man I've ever known.\""""},{""text"":""He shook his head vehemently. \""Today, perhaps.

Have you not noticed the coolness of the Empress and her son toward you?\""""},{""text"":""Barenziah shrugged. Even before she and Septim had become lovers, she'd received no more from his family than bare civility. Threadbare civility. \""What matter? It is Tiber who holds the power.\""""},{""text"":""\""But it is his son who holds the future. Do not put his mother up to public scorn, I beg you.\""""},{""text"":""\""Can I help it if that dry stick of a woman cannot hold her husband's interest even in conversation at dinner?\""""},{""text"":""\""Have less to say in public. That is all I ask. She matters little, it is true -- but her children love her, and you do not want them as enemies. Tiber Septim has not long to live. I mean,\"" Drelliane amended quickly at Barenziah's scowl, \""humans are all short-lived. Ephemeral, as we of the Elder Races say. They come and go as the seasons -- but the families of the powerful ones live on for a time. You must be a friend to this family if you would see lasting profit from your relationship. Ah, but how can I make you see truly, you who are so young and human-bred as well! If you take heed, and wisely, you and Mournhold are like to live to see the fall of Septim's dynasty, if indeed he has founded one, just as you have witnessed its rise. It is the way of human history. They ebb and flow like the inconstant tides. Their cities and dominions bloom like spring flowers, only to wither and die in the summer sun. But the Elves endure. We are as a year to their hour, a decade to their day.\""""},{""text"":""Barenziah just laughed. She knew that rumors abounded about her and Tiber Septim. She enjoyed the attention, for all save the Empress and her son seemed captivated by her. Minstrels sang of her dark beauty and her charming ways.

In small villages and towns, ragged Dark Elven folk gathered along the road to cry her name or simply gape. Most of her knightly escort were Redguards, with a few High Elves, Nords, and Bretons.

She accepted oaths of fealty and allegiance from the people, the nobility, and the council. This last was composed of a blend of Imperial emissaries (\""advisors\"" they were called) and native representatives of the Mournhold people, who were mostly elders in accordance with Elven custom.""},{""text"":""Barenziah later found that much of her time was occupied in attempting to reconcile these two factions and their cronies. The elders were expected to do most of the conciliating, in light of reforms introduced by the Empire pertaining to land ownership and surface farming. But most of these went clean against Dark Elven observances. Tiber Septim, \""in the name of the One,\"" had ordained a new tradition -- and apparently even the gods and goddesses themselves were expected to obey.""},{""text"":""The new Queen threw herself into her work and her studies. She was through with love and men for a long, long time -- if not forever. There were other pleasures, she discovered, as Symmachus had promised her long ago: those of the mind, and those of power. She developed (surprisingly, for she had always rebelled against her tutors at the Imperial City) a deep love for Dark Elven history and mythology, a hunger to know more fully the people from whom she had sprung. She was gratified to learn that they had been proud warriors and skilled craftsmen and cunning mages since time immemorial.""},{""text"":""Tiber Septim lived for another half-century, during which she saw him on several occasions as she was bidden to the Imperial City on one reason of state or another. He greeted her with warmth during these visits, and they even had long talks together about events in the Empire when opportunity would permit. He seemed to have quite forgotten that there had ever been anything between them more than easy friendship and a profound political alliance. He changed little as the years passed. Rumor had it that his mages had developed spells to extend his vitality, and that even the One had granted him immortality. Then one day a messenger came with the news that Tiber Septim was dead, and his grandson Pelagius was now Emperor in his place.""},{""text"":""They had heard the news in private, she and Symmachus. The sometime Imperial General and now her trusted Prime Minister took it stoically, as he took most everything.""},{""text"":""\""Somehow it doesn't seem possible,\"" Barenziah said.""},{""text"":""\""I told you.

She couldn't remember his ever touching her before. She'd never thought of him in that way -- and yet, undeniably, an old familiar warmth spread through her. She'd forgotten how good it felt, that warmth. Not the scorching heat she'd felt with Tiber Septim, but the comforting, robust ardor she somehow associated with... with Straw! Straw. Poor Straw. She hadn't thought of him in so long. He'd be middle-aged now if he were still alive. Probably with a dozen children, she thought affectionately... and a hearty wife who hopefully could talk for two.""},{""text"":""\""Marry me, Barenziah,\"" Symmachus was saying, he seemed to have picked up her thoughts on marriage, children... wives, \""I've worked and toiled and waited long enough, haven't I?\""""},{""text"":""Marriage.

Dark Elven rule had been restored, it was true -- but not the old, not the true nobility. Most of them were upstarts like Symmachus, and not even half as good or deserving as he was. He had fought to keep Mournhold whole and hale when their so-called counselors would have picked at its bones, sucked them dry as Ebonheart had been sucked dry. He'd fought for Mournhold, fought for her, while she and the kingdom grew and thrived. She felt a sudden rush of gratitude -- and, undeniably, affection. He was steady and reliable. And he'd served her well. And loved her well.""},{""text"":""\""Why not?\"" she said, smiling. And took his hand.

But the Queen was quite unshakably popular. \""The Lady Barenziah's one of our own,\"" it was whispered, \""held captive as we.\""""},{""text"":""Barenziah felt content. There was work and there was pleasure -- and what more could one ask of life?""},{""text"":""The years passed swiftly, with crises to be dealt with, and storms and famines and failures to be weathered, and plots to be foiled, and conspirators to be executed. Mournhold prospered steadily. Her people were secure and fed, her mines and farms productive. All was well -- save that the royal marriage had produced  no children. No heirs. \nElven children are slow to come, and most demanding of their welcome -- and noble children more so than others. Thus many decades had come to pass before they grew concerned.""},{""text"":""\""The fault lies with me, Symmachus. I'm damaged goods,\"" Barenziah said bitterly. \""If you want to take another...\""""},{""text"":""\""I want no other,\"" Symmachus said gently, \""nor do I know for certain that the fault is yours.

With Elves there was always time. \nBarenziah sat at dinner in the Great Hall, pushing food about on a plate, feeling bored and restless. Symmachus was away, having been summoned to the Imperial City by Tiber Septim's great-great-grandson, Uriel Septim. Or was it his great-great-great-grandson? She'd lost count, she realized.

How dare he! Barenziah sat up straight and turned to glare at him. Worse, she realized he was singing of some ancient, and now immaterial, war with the Skyrim Nords, praising the heroism of Kings Edward and Moraelyn and their brave Companions.

The going was treacherous for some of the old shafts had collapsed, and they had to clear a passage through the rubble or find a way around the more impassable piles.

That the Queen had been badly shaken by the encounter and deeply mourned the loss of her friend, who had fallen in her defense.

The rivalry between Ebonheart and Mournhold reached back almost to the dawn of Morrowind's history. Once the two nations had been one, all the lucrative mines held in fief by the Ra'athims, whose nobility retained the High Kingship of Morrowind. Ebonheart had split into two separate city-states, Ebonheart and Mournhold, when Queen Lian's twin sons -- grandsons of the legendary King Moraelyn -- were left as joint heirs.

Your appointment is for next week. No, see...\"" And now it wasn't even going well. The Emperor did not even make the slightest pretence at listening to her. He hadn't invited her to sit, nor had he dismissed the children. Helseth stood still as a carven image, but little Morgiah had begun to fuss.""},{""text"":""The state of her own mind didn't help her any. Shortly upon arrival at her lodgings, the Mournholdian ambassador to the Imperial City had demanded entry, bringing with him a sheaf of dispatches from Symmachus. Bad news, and plenty of it. The revolt had finally begun. The peasants had organized around a few disgruntled members of Mournhold's minor nobility, and were demanding Symmachus step down and hand over the reins of government. Only the Imperial Guard and a handful of troops whose families had been retainers of Barenziah's house for generations stood between Symmachus and the rabble. Hostilities had already broken out, but apparently Symmachus was safe and still in control. Not for long, he wrote. He entreated Barenziah to try her best with the Emperor -- but in any case she was to stay in the Imperial City until he wrote to tell her it was safe to go back home with the children.""},{""text"":""She had tried to barge her way through the Imperial bureaucracy -- with little success. And to add to her growing panic, all news from Mournhold had come to a sudden stop. Tottering between rage at the Emperor's numerous major-domos and fear of the fate awaiting her and her family, the weeks had passed by tensely, agonizingly, remorselessly. Then one day the Mournholdian ambassador came calling to tell her she should expect news from Symmachus the following night at the latest, not through the regular channels but by nighthawk. Seemingly by the same stroke of luck, she was informed that same day by a clerk from the Imperial Court that Uriel Septim had finally consented to grant her an audience early on the morrow.""},{""text"":""The Emperor had greeted the three of them when they came into the audience chamber with a too-bright smile of welcome that nonetheless didn't reach his eyes. Then, as she presented her children, he had gazed at them with a fixed attention that was real yet somehow inappropriate. Barenziah had been dealing with humans for nearly five hundred years now, and had developed the skill of reading their expressions and movements that was far beyond what any human could ever perceive. Try as the Emperor might to conceal it, there was hunger in his eyes -- and something else. Regret? Yes. Regret. But why? He had several fine children of his own. Why covet hers? And why look at her with such a vicious -- however brief -- yearning? Perhaps he had tired of his consort. Humans were notoriously, though predictably, inconstant. After that one long, burning glance, his gaze had shifted away as she began to speak of her mission and the violence that had erupted in Mournhold. He sat still as stone throughout her entire account.""},{""text"":""Puzzled at his inertia, and vexed no end, Barenziah stared into the pale, set face, looking for some trace of the Septims she'd known in the past. She didn't know Uriel Septim well, having met him once when he was still a child, and then again at his coronation twenty years later. Twice, that was all. He'd been a stern and dignified presence at the ceremony, even as a young adult -- yet not icily remote as this more mature man was. In fact, despite the physical resemblance, he didn't seem to be the same man at all. Not the same, yet something about him was familiar to her, more familiar than it should be, some trick of posture or gesture...""},{""text"":""Suddenly she felt very hot, as if lava had been poured over her. Illusion! She had studied the arts of illusion well since the Nightingale had deceived her so badly. She had learned to detect it -- and she felt it now, as certainly as a blind man could feel the sun on his face. Illusion! But why? Her mind worked furiously even as her mouth went on reciting details about Mournhold's troubles. Vanity? Humans were oft as ashamed at the signs of ageing as Elves were proud to exhibit them. Yet the face Uriel Septim wore seemed consistent with his age.""},{""text"":""Barenziah dared use none of her own magic. Even petty nobles had means of detecting magicka, if not actually shielding themselves from its effects, within their own halls. The use of sorcery here would bring down the Emperor's wrath as surely as drawing a dagger would.""},{""text"":""Magic.""},{""text"":""Illusion.""},{""text"":""Suddenly she was brought to mind of the Nightingale. And then he was sitting before her. Then the vision changed, and it was Uriel Septim. He looked sad. Trapped.

Pale skin, bloodshot eyes, Elven ears -- and about him a fierce glow of concentrated malice, an aura of eldritch energy -- a horrible, destructive shimmer. This man was capable of anything!""},{""text"":""And then once again she was looking into the face of Uriel Septim.""},{""text"":""How could she be sure she wasn't imagining things? Perhaps her mind was playing tricks on her. She felt a sudden vast weariness, as if she'd been carrying a heavy burden too long and too far. She decided to abandon her earnest narrative of Mournhold's ills -- as it was quite plainly getting her nowhere -- and switch back to pleasantry. Pleasantry, however, with a hidden agenda.""},{""text"":""\""Do you remember, Sire, Symmachus and I had dinner with your family shortly after your father's coronation?

A nod from the Emperor dismissed them, and they backed away from the imperial presence.""},{""text"":""She took a deep breath when they emerged from the throne room. \""Justin\"" had been an imaginary playmate, although young Uriel had insisted a place be set for Justin at every meal. Not only that, Justin, despite the boyish name, had been a girl! Symmachus had kept up the joke long after she had gone the way of imaginary childhood friends -- inquiring after Justin's health whenever he and Uriel Septim met, and being responded to in as mock-serious a fashion. The last Barenziah had heard of Justin, several years ago, the Emperor had evidently joked elaborately to Symmachus that she had met an adventurous though incorrigible Khajiit youth, married him, and settled down in Lilandril to raise fire ferns and mugworts.""},{""text"":""The man sitting on the Emperor's divan was not Uriel Septim!

Symmachus had been wrong, so wrong...""},{""text"":""What now? she wondered frantically. What had become of Uriel Septim -- and more to the point, what did it mean for her and Symmachus, and all of Mournhold? Thinking back, Barenziah guessed that their troubles were due to this false Emperor, this Nightingale-spawned glamour -- or whatever he really was. He must have taken Uriel Septim's place shortly before the unreasonable demands on Mournhold had begun. That would explain why relations had deteriorated for so long (as humans reckoned time), long after her disapproved liaison with Tiber Septim. The Nightingale knew of Symmachus' famed loyalty to, and knowledge of, the Septim House, and was effecting a pre-emptive strike. If that were the case, they were all in terrible danger. She and the children were in his power here in the Imperial City, and Symmachus was left alone to deal with troubles of the Nightingale's brewing in Mournhold.""},{""text"":""What must she do? Barenziah impelled the children ahead of her, a hand on each shoulder, trying to stay cool, collected, her ladies-in-waiting and personal knights escort trailing behind. Finally they reached their waiting carriage.

The carriage seemed a kind of refuge now, false as she knew the feeling must be.""},{""text"":""A boy dashed up to one of the guards and handed him a scroll, then pointed toward the carriage. The guard brought it to her. The boy waited, eyes wide and shining.

She wanted only to leave this city! Certainly she had no inclination toward any dalliance with a dazzled human. She looked up, frowning, and one of the guards said, \""Milady, the boy says his master awaits your reply yonder.\"" She looked in the direction indicated and saw a handsome elderly man on horseback, surrounded by a half dozen courtiers and cavaliers. He caught her eye and bowed respectfully, taking off a plumed hat.""},{""text"":""\""Very well,\"" Barenziah said to the boy on impulse. \""Tell your master he may call on me tonight, after the dinner hour.\"" King Eadwyre looked polite and grave, and rather worried -- but not in the least lovestruck. At least that was something, she thought pensively. \nBarenziah stood at the tower window, waiting. She could sense the familiar's nearness. But though the night sky was clear as day to her eyes, she could not yet see him. Then suddenly he was there, a swift moving dot beneath the wispy night clouds. A few more minutes and the great nighthawk finished its descent, wings folding, talons reaching for her thick leather armband.""},{""text"":""She carried the bird to its perch, where it waited, panting, as her impatient fingers felt for the message secured in a capsule on one leg. The hawk drank mightily from the water till when she had done, then ruffled its feathers and preened, secure in her presence.

She had chosen a Champion who would undertake to find the Staff of Chaos, which had been hidden by the traitorous sorcerer in an unknown site. This Champion was to wield the Staff's power to destroy Jagar Tharn, who was otherwise invulnerable, and rescue the true Emperor being held prisoner in another dimension. However, the Champion, while thankfully still alive, now languished in the Imperial Dungeons. Tharn's attention must be diverted while the chosen one gained freedom with Ria's spirit's help.

She still couldn't bring herself to accept the fact that Symmachus was dead. But even if he is, she told herself firmly, my love is alive, and remains. He would always be with her. As would the pain. The pain of living the rest of her life without him. The pain of trying to survive each day, each night, without his presence, his comfort, his love.

Nor could he openly declare war on Wayrest. He had no legitimate claim on her or her unborn child.

She in her turn did not love him -- but she was fond of him, and that was something.

He was a miner, as was his father before him, a common laborer in the mines of the Lord of Mournhold, for his ability in magicka was small. The work was honorable but paid poorly. His mother made and sold comberry cakes at the city market to help eke out their living. They did well enough, she said, they had enough to fill their bellies, no one could wear more than one suit of clothing at a time, and the roof leaked only when it rained. But Symmachus would have liked more. He hoped for a lucky strike at the mines, which would garner him a large bonus. In his free hours he enjoyed hoisting a mug of ale in the tavern with his friends, and gambling with them at cards. He also drew the eyes and sighs of more than one pretty Elven lass, although none held his interest for long. He was a typical young Dark Elf of peasant descent, remarkable only for his size. It was rumored that he had a bit of Nordic blood in him.""},{""text1"":""In Symmachus' thirtieth year, there was great rejoicing in Mournhold-a girl-child had been born to the Lord and Lady.

Other, less desirable Dark Elven traits evidently included pilfering, lying, and a little misplaced magic, just a small fire spell here and a little levitation spell there. And, as she grew older, a keen interest in boys and men, who could provide very pleasant sensations -- and to her astonishment, gifts as well. Inga disapproved of this last for reasons incomprehensible to Barenziah, so she was careful to keep it as secret as possible.""},{""text1"":""\""She's wonderful with the children,\"" Inga added, referring to her five sons, all younger than Barenziah. \""I don't think she'd ever let them come to harm.\"" A tutor had been hired when Jonni was six and Barenziah eight, and they took their lessons together. She would have liked to train in arms as well, but the very idea scandalized Count Sven and Lady Inga. So Barenziah was given a small bow and allowed to play at target shooting with the boys.

The stable-boy, Straw, a big, muscular blond lad, clumsy, gentle, affectionate, and rather simple, had been urging her to run off for some weeks now. Barenziah stole the bag of gold the courier had left, took the mushrooms from the storeroom, disguised herself as a boy in one of Jonni's old tunics and a pair of his cast-off breeches... and on one fine spring night she and Straw took the two best horses from the stable and rode hard through the night toward Whiterun, the nearest city of any importance and the place where Straw wanted to be.

They went on at dusk and came to Whiterun's city gates just before dawn. Barenziah had prepared a pass of sorts for Straw, a makeshift document stating an errand to a temple in the city for a local village lord. She herself glided over the wall with the help of a levitation spell. She had reasoned-correctly, as it turned out-that by now the gate guards would have been alerted to keep an eye out for a young Dark Elven girl and a Nordic boy traveling together. On the other hand, unaccompanied country yokels like Straw were a common enough sight. Alone and with papers, it was unlikely that he would draw attention.""},{""text1"":""Her simple plan went smoothly.

Straw, however, had never been more than a few miles from Sven's estate, which was his birthplace.""},{""text1"":""Together they made their way to a rundown inn in the poorer quarters of Whiterun. Gloved, cloaked, and hooded against the morning chill, Barenziah's dark skin and red eyes were not apparent and no one paid any heed to them. They entered the inn separately. Straw paid the innkeeper for a single cubicle, an immense meal, and two jugs of ale. Barenziah sneaked in a few minutes later.""},{""text1"":""They ate and drank together gleefully, rejoicing in their escape, and made love vigorously on the narrow cot.

How are ye with yon bow, Dark Elf?\"" Barenziah demonstrated her prowess briefly. \""Aye, not bad, not bad 'tall. And ye'll be keen of eye by night, boy, and of hearin' 'tall times.

The Emperor Tiber Septim I had done much in the way of building relatively safe and regularly patrolled highways.

This exposed them to the hazards of wayside robbers, both human and Orcish, and roving brigand bands of various races. But such were the perils of trade and profit.""},{""text1"":""They had two such encounters before reaching Sunguard -- an ambush which Barenziah's keen ears warned them of in plenty of time for them to circle about and surprise the lurkers, and a night attack by a mixed band of Khajiit, humans, and Wood Elves. The latter were a skilled band and even Barenziah did not hear them sneaking up in time to give much warning. This time the fighting was fierce. The attackers were driven off, but two of the caravan's other guards were slain and Straw got a nasty cut on his thigh before he and Barenziah managed to gash his Khajiit assailant's throat.""},{""text1"":""Barenziah rather enjoyed the life. The garrulous sergeant had taken a liking to her, and she spent most of her evenings sitting around the campfire listening to his tales of campaigning in Morrowind with Tiber Septim and General Symmachus.

Barenziah rather missed it too, but not as much as Straw did, seemingly.""},{""text1"":""The sergeant wanted them to sign on for the return trip, but gave them a bonus nonetheless when they turned the offer down, and parchments of recommendation.""},{""text1"":""Straw wanted to settle down permanently near Sunguard, but Barenziah insisted on continuing their travels east. \""I'm the Queen of Mournhold by rights,\"" she said, unsure whether it was true -- or was it just a daydream she had made up as a lost, bewildered child? \""I want to go home.

Will you become a washing-woman for them? Or a camp follower?\""""},{""text1"":""\""No,\"" Barenziah said slowly, thoughtfully. Actually the idea was not entirely unappealing. She was sure she could earn a modest living by sleeping with the soldiers. She'd had a few adventures of that sort as they crossed Skyrim, when she'd dressed as a woman and slipped away from Straw. She'd only been looking for a bit of variety. Straw was sweet but dull. She'd been startled, but extremely pleased, when the men she picked up offered her money afterward.

She taught Barenziah an invisibility spell and schooled her in other forms of stealth and disguise. Katisha mingled magical and non-magical talents freely, using one set to enhance the other.

Therris had said it was a simple job but very hush-hush. He hadn't even wanted to bring any other Guild members along. He said he knew he could trust Berry and Straw, but no one else.""},{""text1"":""\""Tell me what you're looking for and I'll find it,\"" Berry whispered urgently. Therris' night sight wasn't as good as hers and he didn't want her to magick up even a small orb of light.""},{""text1"":""She had never been in such a luxurious place. Not even the Darkmoor castle of Count Sven and Lady Inga where she had spent her childhood compared to it. She'd gazed around in wonder as they made their way through the ornately decorated and hugely echoing downstairs rooms. But Therris didn't seem interested in anything but the desk in the small book-lined study on the upper floor.""},{""text1"":""\""Sssst,\"" he hissed angrily.""},{""text1"":""\""Someone's coming!\"" Berry said, a moment before the door opened and two dark figures stepped into the room. Therris gave her a violent shove toward them and sprang to the window. Barenziah's muscles went rigid; she couldn't move or even speak. She watched helplessly as one of the figures, the smaller one, leaped after Therris. There were two quick, silent stabs of blue light, then Therris folded over into a still heap.""},{""text1"":""Outside the study the house had come alive with hastening footsteps and voices calling out in alarm and the clank of armor hurriedly put on.""},{""text1"":""The bigger man, a Dark Elf by the looks of him, half-lifted, half-dragged Therris to the door and thrust him into the waiting arms of another Elf. A jerk of the first Elf's head sent his smaller blue-robed companion after them. Then he sauntered over to inspect Barenziah, who was once again able to move although her head throbbed maddeningly when she tried to.""},{""text1"":""\""Open your shirt, Barenziah,\"" the Elf said. Barenziah gawked at him and clutched it closed. \""You're a girl, aren't you, Berry?\"" he said softly. \""You should have stopped dressing as a boy months ago, you know. You were only drawing attention to yourself. And calling yourself Berry! Is your friend Straw too stupid to remember anything else?\""""},{""text1"":""\""It's a common Elven name,\"" Barenziah defended.""},{""text1"":""The man shook his head sadly. \""Not among Dark Elves it isn't, my dear. But you wouldn't know much about Dark Elves, would you? I regret that, but it couldn't be helped. No matter. I shall try to remedy it.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Who are you?\"" Barenziah demanded.""},{""text1"":""\""Ai. So much for fame,\"" the man shrugged, smiling wryly. \""I am Symmachus, Milady Barenziah. General Symmachus of His Awesome and Terrible Majesty Tiber Septim I's Imperial Army. And I must say it's a merry chase you've led me throughout Tamriel. Or this part of it, anyway. Although I guessed, and guessed correctly, that you'd head for Morrowind eventually. You had a bit of luck. A body was found in Whiterun that was thought to be Straw's. So we stopped looking for the pair of you. That was careless of me. Yet I'd not have thought you'd have stayed together this long.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Where is he? Is he all right?\"" she asked in genuine trepidation.""},{""text1"":""\""Oh, he's fine. For now. In custody, of course.\"" He turned away. \""You ... care for him, then?\"" he said, and then suddenly stared at her with fierce curiosity. Out of red eyes that seemed strange to her, except in her own seldom-seen reflection.""},{""text1"":""\""He's my friend,\"" Barenziah said. The words came out in a tone that sounded dull and hopeless to her own ears. Symmachus! A general in the Imperial Army, no less--said to have the friendship and ears of Tiber Septim himself.""},{""text1"":""\""Ai. You seem to have several unsuitable friends--if you'll forgive my saying so, Milady.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Stop calling me that.\"" She was irritated at the general's seeming sarcasm. But he only smiled.""},{""text1"":""As they talked the bustle and flurry in the house died away. Although she could still hear people, presumably the residents, whispering together not far off. The tall Elf perched himself on a corner of the desk. He seemed quite relaxed and prepared to stay awhile.""},{""text1"":""Then it occurred to her. Several unsuitable friends, had he said? This man knew all about her! Or seemed to know enough, anyway. Which amounted to the same thing. \""W-what's going to happen to them? To m-me?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Ah. As you know, this house belongs to the commander of the Imperial troops in this area. Which means to say that it belongs to me.\"" Barenziah gasped and Symmachus looked up sharply. \""What, you didn't know? Tsk, tsk. Why, you are rash, Milady, even for seventeen. You must always know what it is you do, or get yourself into.\""""},{""text1"":""\""B-but the G-guild w-wouldn't ... wouldn't h-have--\"" Barenziah was trembling. The Thieves Guild would never have attempted a mission that crossed Imperial policy. No one dared oppose Tiber Septim, at least no one she knew of. Someone at the Guild had bungled. Badly. And now she was going to pay for it.""},{""text1"":""\""I daresay. It's unlikely that Therris had Guild approval for this. In fact, I wonder--\"" Symmachus examined the desk carefully, pulling out drawers. He selected one, placed it on top of the desk, and removed a false bottom. There was a folded sheet of parchment inside. It seemed to be a map of some sort. Barenziah edged closer. Symmachus held it away from her, laughing. \""Rash indeed!\"" He glanced it over, then folded and replaced it.""},{""text1"":""\""You advised me a moment ago to seek after knowledge.\""""},{""text1"":""\""So I did, so I did.\"" Suddenly he seemed to be in high good humor. \""We must be going, my dear Lady.\""""},{""text1"":""He shepherded her to the door, down the stairs, and out into the night air. No one was about. Barenziah's eyes darted toward the shadows. She wondered if she could outrun him, or elude him somehow.""},{""text1"":""\""You're not thinking of attempting to escape, are you? Ai. Don't you want to hear first what my plans for you are?\"" She thought that he sounded a bit hurt.""},{""text1"":""\""Now that you mention it--yes.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Perhaps you'd rather hear about your friends first.\""""},{""text1"":""\""No.\""""},{""text1"":""He looked gratified at this. It was evidently the answer he wanted, thought Barenziah, but it was also the truth. While she was concerned for her friends, especially Straw, she was far more concerned for herself.""},{""text1"":""\""You will take your place as the rightful Queen of Mournhold.\""""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""Symmachus explained that this had been his, and Tiber Septim's, plan for her all along. That Mournhold, which had been under military rule for the dozen or so years since she had been away, was gradually to be returned to civilian government--under the Empire's guidance, of course, and as part of the Imperial Province of Morrowind.""},{""text1"":""\""But why was I sent to Darkmoor?\"" Barenziah asked, hardly believing anything she had just been told.""},{""text1"":""\""For safekeeping, naturally. Why did you run away?\""""},{""text1"":""Barenziah shrugged. \""I saw no reason to stay. I should have been told.\""""},{""text1"":""\""You would have been by now. I had in fact sent for you to be removed to the Imperial City to spend some time as part of the Emperor's household. But of course you had, shall we say, absconded by then. As for your destiny, it should be, and should have been, quite obvious to you. Tiber Septim does not keep those he has no use for -- and what else could you be that would be of use to him?\""""},{""text1"":""\""I know nothing of him. Nor, for that matter, of you.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Then know this: Tiber Septim rewards friends and foes alike according to their deserts.\""""},{""text1"":""Barenziah chewed on that for a few moments. \""Straw has deserved well of me and has never done anyone any harm. He is not a member of the Thieves Guild. He came along to protect me. He earns our keep by running errands, and he ... he ...\""""},{""text1"":""Symmachus waved her impatiently to silence. \""Ai. I know all about Straw,\"" he said, \""and about Therris.\"" He stared at her intently. \""So? What would you?\""""},{""text1"":""She took a deep breath. \""Straw wants a little farm. If I'm to be rich, then I would like for one to be given to him.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Very well.\"" He seemed astonished at this, and then pleased. \""Done. He shall have it. And Therris?\""""},{""text1"":""\""He betrayed me,\"" Barenziah said coldly. Therris should have told her what risks the job entailed. Besides, he'd pushed her right into their enemies' arms in an attempt to save himself. Not a man to be rewarded. Not, in fact, a man to be trusted.""},{""text1"":""\""Yes. And?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Well, he should be made to suffer for it ... shouldn't he?\""""},{""text1"":""\""That seems reasonable. What form should said suffering take?\""""},{""text1"":""Barenziah balled her hands into fists. She would've liked to beat and claw at the Khajiit herself. But considering the turn events had taken, that didn't seem very queenly. \""A whipping. Er ... would twenty stripes be too many, do you think? I don't want to do him any permanent injury, you understand. Just teach him a lesson.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Ai. Of course.\"" Symmachus grinned at this. Then his features suddenly set, and became serious. \""It shall be done, Your Highness, Milady Queen Barenziah of Mournhold.\"" Then he bowed to her, a sweeping, courtly, ridiculously wonderful bow.""},{""text1"":""Barenziah's heart leapt.""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""She spent two days at Symmachus' apartment, during which she was kept very busy. There was a Dark Elven woman named Drelliane who saw to her needs, although she did not exactly seem a servant since she took her meals with them. Nor did she seem to be Symmachus' wife, or lover. Drelliane looked amused when Barenziah asked her about it. She simply said she was in the general's employ and did whatever was asked of her.""},{""text1"":""With Drelliane's assistance, several fine gowns and pairs of shoes were ordered for her, plus a riding habit and boots, along with other small necessities. Barenziah was given a room to herself.""},{""text1"":""Symmachus was out a great deal. She saw him at most mealtimes, but he said little about himself or what he had been doing. He was cordial and polite, quite willing to converse on most subjects, and seemed interested in anything she had to say. Drelliane was much the same. Barenziah found them pleasant enough, but \""hard to get to know,\"" as Katisha would have put it. She felt an odd twinge of disappointment. These were the first Dark Elves with whom she'd associated closely. She had expected to feel comfortable with them, to feel at last that she belonged somewhere, with somebody, as part of something. Instead she found herself yearning for her Nordic friends, Katisha and Straw.""},{""text1"":""When Symmachus told her they were to set out for the Imperial City on the morrow, she asked if she could say good-bye to them.""},{""text1"":""\""Katisha?\"" he asked. \""Ai. But then ... I suppose I owe her something. She it was who led me to you by telling me of a lonely Dark Elven girl named Berry who needed Elven friends -- and who sometimes dressed as a boy. She has no association with the Thieves Guild, apparently. And no one associated with the Thieves Guild seems to know your true identity, save Therris. That is well. I prefer that your former Guild membership not be made public knowledge. Please speak of it to no one, Your Highness. Such a past does not ... become an Imperial Queen.\""""},{""text1"":""\""No one knows but Straw and Therris. And they won't tell anyone.\""""},{""text1"":""\""No.\"" He smiled a curious little smile. \""No, they won't.\""""},{""text1"":""He didn't know that Katisha knew, then. But still, there was something about the way he said it ...""},{""text1"":""Straw came to their apartment on the morning of their departure. They were left alone in the salon, although Barenziah knew that other Elves were within earshot. He looked drawn and pale. They hugged one another silently for a few minutes. Straw's shoulders were shaking and tears were rolling down his cheeks, but he said nothing.""},{""text1"":""Barenziah tried a smile. \""So we both get what we want, eh? I'm to be Queen of Mournhold and you'll be lord of your own farmstead.\"" She took his hand, smiled at him warmly, genuinely. \""I'll write you, Straw. I promise. You must find a scribe so you can write me too.\""""},{""text1"":""Straw shook his head sadly. When Barenziah persisted, he opened his mouth and pointed at it, making inarticulate noises. Then she realized what it was. His tongue was gone, had been cut off.""},{""text1"":""Barenziah collapsed onto a chair and wept noisily.""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""\""But why?\"" she demanded of Symmachus when Straw had been ushered away. \""Why?\""""},{""text1"":""Symmachus shrugged. \""He knows too much. He could be dangerous. At least he's alive, and he won't need his tongue to ... raise pigs or whatever.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I hate you!\"" Barenziah screamed at him, then abruptly doubled over and vomited on the floor. She continued to revile him between intermittent bouts of nausea. He listened stolidly for some time while Drelliane cleaned up after her. Finally, he told her to cease or he would gag her for her journey to the Emperor.""},{""text1"":""They stopped at Katisha's house on their way out of the city. Symmachus and Drelliane didn't dismount. All seemed normal but Barenziah was frightened as she knocked on the door. Katisha answered the knock. Barenziah thanked the gods silently that at least she was all right. But she'd also obviously been weeping. In any case, she embraced Barenziah warmly.""},{""text1"":""\""Why are you crying?\"" Barenziah asked.""},{""text1"":""\""For Therris, of course. You haven't heard? Oh dear. Poor Therris. He's dead.\"" Barenziah felt icy fingers creeping round her heart. \""He was caught stealing from the Commandant's house. Poor fellow, but that was so foolish of him. Oh, Berry, he was drawn and quartered this very dawn by the Commandant's order!\"" She started to sob. \""I went. He asked for me. It was terrible. He suffered so before he died. I'll never forget it. I looked for you and Straw, but no one knew where you'd both gone to.\"" She glanced behind Barenziah. \""That's the Commandant, isn't it? Symmachus.\"" Then Katisha did a strange thing. She stopped crying and grinned. \""You know, the moment I saw him, I thought, This is the one for Barenziah!\"" Katisha took a fold of her apron and wiped it across her eyes. \""I told him about you, you know.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Yes,\"" Barenziah said, \""I know.\"" She took Katisha's hands in each of hers and looked at her earnestly. \""Katisha, I love you. I'm going to miss you. But please don't ever tell anyone else anything about me. Ever. Swear you won't. Especially not to Symmachus. And look after Straw for me. Promise me that.\""""},{""text1"":""Katisha promised, puzzled though willing. \""Berry, it wasn't somehow because of me that Therris was caught, was it? I never said anything about Therris to ... to ... him.\"" She glanced over at the general.""},{""text1"":""Barenziah assured her that it wasn't, that an informant had told the Imperial Guard of Therris' plans. Which was probably a lie, but she could see that Katisha plainly needed some kind of comfort.""},{""text1"":""\""Oh, I'm glad of that, if I can be glad of anything just now. I'd hate to think-- But how could I have known?\"" She leaned over and whispered in Barenziah's ear, \""Symmachus is very handsome, don't you think? And so charming.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I wouldn't know about that,\"" Barenziah said dryly. \""I haven't really thought about it. There've been other things to think about.\"" She explained hurriedly about being Queen of Mournhold and going to live in the Imperial City for a while. \""He was looking for me, that's all. On orders from the Emperor. I was the object of a quest, nothing more than some sort of... of a... goal. I don't think he thinks of me as a woman at all. He said I didn't look like a boy, though,\"" she added in the face of Katisha's incredulity. Katisha knew that Barenziah evaluated every male she met in terms of sexual desirability, and availability. \""I suppose it's the shock of finding out that I really am a queen,\"" she added, and Katisha agreed that yes, that's true, that must've been something of a shock, although one there was no likelihood of her experiencing firsthand. She smiled. Barenziah smiled with her. Then they hugged again, tearfully, for the last time. She never saw Katisha again. Or Straw. \nThe royal party left Rifton by the great southern gate. Once through, Symmachus tapped her shoulder and pointed back at the portals. \""I thought you might want to say good-bye to Therris too, Your Highness,\"" he said.""},{""text1"":""Barenziah stared briefly but steadily at the head impaled on a spike above the gate. The birds had been at it, but the face was still recognizable. \""I don't think he'll hear me, although I'm quite sure he'll be pleased to know I'm fine,\"" she said, seeming to sound light. \""Let's be on our way, General, shall we?\""""},{""text1"":""Symmachus was clearly disappointed by her lack of reaction. \""Ai. You heard of this from your friend Katisha, I suppose?\""""},{""text1"":""\""You suppose correctly. She attended the execution,\"" Barenziah said casually. If he didn't know already, he'd find out soon enough, she was sure of that.""},{""text1"":""\""Did she know Therris belonged to the Guild?\""""},{""text1"":""She shrugged. \""Everyone knew that. It's only lower-ranking members like me who are supposed to keep their membership secret. The ones higher up are well known.\"" She turned to smile archly at him. \""But you must know all that, shouldn't you, General?\"" she said sweetly.""},{""text1"":""He seemed unaffected by this. \""So you told her who you were and whence you came, but not about the Guild.\""""},{""text1"":""\""The Guild membership was not my secret to tell. The other was. There's a difference. Besides, Katisha is a very honest woman. Had I told her, it would have lessened me in her eyes. She was always after Therris to take up a more honest line of work. I value her good opinion.\"" She afforded him a glacial stare. \""Not that it's any concern of yours, but do you know what else she thought? She also thought I'd be happier if I settled down with just one man. One of my own race. One of my own race with all the right qualities. One of my own race with all the right qualities, who knows to say all the right things. You, in fact.\"" She grabbed the reins preparatory to assuming a brisker pace--but not without sinking one final irresistible barb. \""Isn't it odd how wishes come true sometimes--but not in the way you want them to? Or maybe I should say, not in the way you would ever want them to?\""""},{""text1"":""His answer so took her by surprise that she quite forgot about cantering off. \""Yes. Very odd,\"" he replied, and his tone matched his words exactly. Then he excused himself and fell behind.""},{""text1"":""She held her head high and urged her mount onward, trying to look unimpressed. Now what was it about his response that bothered her? Not what he said. No, that wasn't it. But something about the way he said it. Something about it made her think that she, Barenziah, was one of his wishes that had come true. Unlikely as this seemed, she gave it due deliberation. He had found her at last, after months of searching, it seemed, under pressure from the Emperor, no doubt. So his wish had come true. Yes, that must be it.""},{""text1"":""But in a way, apparently, not altogether to his liking.""},{""text1"":""For several days, Barenziah felt a weight of sorrow at her separation from her friends. But by the second week out her spirits began to rise a little. She found that she enjoyed being on the road again, although she missed Straw's companionship more than she would have thought. They were escorted by a troop of Redguard knights with whom she felt comfortable, although these were much more disciplined, and decorous, than the guards of the merchant caravans she had spent time with. They were genial but respectful toward her despite her attempts at flirtation.""},{""text1"":""Symmachus scolded her privately, saying a queen must maintain royal dignity at all times.""},{""text1"":""\""You mean I'm never to have any fun?\"" she inquired petulantly.""},{""text1"":""\""Ai. Not with such as these. They are beneath you. Graciousness is to be desired from those in authority, Milady. Familiarity is not. You will remain chaste and modest while you are at the Imperial City.\""""},{""text1"":""Barenziah made a face. \""I might as well be back at Darkmoor Keep. Elves are promiscuous by nature, you know. Everyone says so.\""""},{""text1"":""\""'Everyone' is wrong, then. Some are, some aren't. The Emperor -- and I -- expect you to display both discrimination and good taste. Let me remind you, Your Highness, that you hold the throne of Mournhold not by right of blood but solely at the pleasure of Tiber Septim. If he judges you unsuitable, your reign will end ere it begins. He requires intelligence, obedience, discretion, and total loyalty of all his appointees, and he favors chastity and modesty in women. I strongly suggest you model your deportment after our good Drelliane. Milady.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I'd as lief be back in Darkmoor!\"" Barenziah snapped resentfully, offended at the thought of emulating the frigid, prudish Drelliane in any way.""},{""text1"":""\""That is not an option. Your Highness. If you are of no use to Tiber Septim, he will see to it that you are of no use to his enemies either,\"" the general said portentously. \""If you would keep your head on your shoulders, take heed. Let me add that power offers pleasures other than those of carnality and cavorting with base company.\""""},{""text1"":""He began to speak of art, literature, drama, music, and the grand balls thrown at the Imperial Court. Barenziah listened with growing interest, spurred on not entirely by his threats. But afterward she asked timidly if she might continue her study of magic while at the Imperial City. Symmachus seemed pleased at this and promised to arrange it. Encouraged, she then said that she noted three of their knights escort were women, and asked if she might train a little with them, just for the sake of exercise. The general looked less delighted at this, but gave his consent, though stressing it would only be with the women.""},{""text1"":""The late winter weather held fair, though slightly frosty, for the rest of their journey so that they traveled quickly over firm roads. On the last day of their trip, spring seemed to have arrived at last for there were hints of a thaw. The road grew muddy underfoot, and everywhere one could hear water trickling and dripping faintly but steadily. It was a welcome sound.""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""They came to the great bridge that crossed into the Imperial City at sunset. The rosy glow turned the stark white marble edifices of the metropolis a delicate pink. It all looked very new and grand and immaculate. A broad avenue led north toward the Palace. A crowd of people of all sorts and races filled the wide concourse. Lights winked out in the shops and on in the inns as dusk fell and stars came out singly then by twos and threes. Even the side streets were broad and brightly illuminated. Near the Palace the towers of an immense Mages Guildhall reared toward the east, while westward the stained glass windows of a huge tabernacle glittered in the dying light.""},{""text1"":""Symmachus had apartments in a magnificent house two blocks from the palace, past the temple. (\""The Temple of the One,\"" he identified as they passed it, an ancient Nordic cult which Tiber Septim had revived. He said that Barenziah would be expected to become a member should she prove acceptable to the Emperor.) The place was quite splendid--although little to Barenziah's taste. The walls and furnishings were done in utter pristine white, relieved only by touches of dull gold, and the floors in dully gleaming black marble. Barenziah's eyes ached for color and the interplay of subtle shadings.""},{""text1"":""In the morning Symmachus and Drelliane escorted her to the Imperial Palace. Barenziah noted that everyone they met greeted Symmachus with a deferential respect in some cases bordering on obsequiousness. The general seemed to take it for granted.""},{""text1"":""They were ushered directly into the imperial presence. Morning sun flooded a small room through a large window with tiny panes, washing over a sumptuously laden breakfast table and the single man who sat there, dark against the light. He leapt to his feet as they entered and hurried toward them. \""Ah, Symmachus our most loyal friend, we welcome your return most gladly.\"" His hands held Symmachus' shoulders briefly, fondly, halting the deep genuflection the Dark Elf had been in the process of effecting.""},{""text1"":""Barenziah curtseyed as Tiber Septim turned to her.""},{""text1"":""\""Barenziah, our naughty little runaway. How do you do, child? Here, let us have a look at you. Why, Symmachus, she's charming, absolutely charming. Why have you hidden her from us all these years? Is the light too much, child? Shall we draw the hangings? Yes, of course.\"" He waved aside Symmachus' protests and drew the curtains himself, not troubling to summon a servant. \""You will pardon us for this discourtesy toward yourselves, our dear guests. We've much to think of, though that's scant excuse for hospitality's neglect. But ah! pray join us. There's some excellent nectarines from Black Marsh.\""""},{""text1"":""They settled themselves at the table. Barenziah was dumbfounded. Tiber Septim was nothing like the grim, grey, giant warrior she'd pictured. He was of average height, fully half a head shorter than tall Symmachus, although he was well-knit of figure and lithe of movement. He had a winning smile, bright -- indeed piercing -- blue eyes, and a full head of stark white hair above a lined and weathered face. He might have been any age from forty to sixty. He pressed food and drink upon them, then repeated the question the general had asked her days ago: Why had she left home? Had her guardians been unkind to her?""},{""text1"":""\""No, Excellency,\"" Barenziah replied, \""in truth, no -- although I fancied so at times.\"" Symmachus had fabricated a story for her, and Barenziah told it now, although with a certain misgiving. The stable-boy, Straw, had convinced her that her guardians, unable to find a suitable husband for her, meant to sell her off as a concubine in Rihad; and when a Redguard had indeed come, she had panicked and fled with Straw.""},{""text1"":""Tiber Septim seemed fascinated and listened raptly as she provided details of her life as a merchant caravan escort. \""Why, 'tis like a ballad!\"" he said. \""By the One, we'll have the Court Bard set it to music. What a charming boy you must have made.\""""},{""text1"":""\""General Symmachus said--\"" Barenziah stopped in some confusion, then proceeded. \""He said -- well, that I no longer look much like a boy. I have... grown in the past few months.\"" She lowered her gaze in what she hoped approximated maidenly modesty.""},{""text1"":""\""He's a very discerning fellow, is our loyal friend Symmachus.\""""},{""text1"":""\""I know I've been a very foolish girl, Excellency. I must crave your pardon, and that of my kind guardians. I... I realized that some time ago, but I was too ashamed to go back home. But I don't want to return to Darkmoor now. Excellency, I long for Mournhold. My soul pines for my own country.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Our dear child. You shall go home, we promise you. But we pray you remain with us a little longer, that you may prepare yourself for the grave and solemn task with which we shall charge you.\""""},{""text1"":""Barenziah gazed at him earnestly, heart beating fast. It was all working just as Symmachus had said it would. She felt a warm flush of gratitude toward him, but was careful to keep her attention focused on the Emperor. \""I am honored, Excellency, and wish most earnestly to serve you and this great Empire you have built in any way I can.\"" It was the politic thing to say, to be sure -- but Barenziah really meant it. She was awed at the magnificence of the city and the discipline and order evident everywhere, and moreover was excited at the prospect of being a part of it all. And she felt quite taken by the gentle Tiber Septim.""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""After a few days Symmachus left for Mournhold to take up the duties of a governor until Barenziah was ready to assume the throne, after which he would become her Prime Minister. Barenziah, with Drelliane as chaperone, took up residence in a suite of rooms at the Imperial Palace. Several tutors were provided her, in all the fields deemed seemly for a queenly education. During this time she became deeply interested in the magical arts, but she found the study of history and politics not at all to her preference.""},{""text1"":""On occasion she met with Tiber Septim in the Palace gardens and he would unfailingly and politely inquire as to her progress -- and chide her, although with a smile, for her disinterest at matters of state. However, he was always happy to instruct her on the finer points of magic, and he could make even history and politics seem interesting. \""They're people, child, not dry facts in a dusty volume,\"" he said.""},{""text1"":""As her understanding broadened, their discussions grew longer, deeper, more frequent. He spoke to her of his vision of a united Tamriel, each race separate and distinct but with shared ideals and goals, all contributing to the common weal. \""Some things are universal, shared by all sentient folk of good will,\"" he said. \""So the One teaches us. We must unite against the malicious and the brutish, the miscreated -- the Orcs, trolls, goblins, and other worse creatures -- and not strive against one another.\"" His blue eyes would light up as he stared into his dream, and Barenziah was delighted just to sit and listen to him. If he drew close to her, the side of her body next to him would glow as if he were a smoldering blaze. If their hands met she would tingle all over as if his body were charged with a shock spell.""},{""text1"":""One day, quite unexpectedly, he took her face in his hands and kissed her gently on the mouth. She drew back after a few moments, astonished by the violence of her feelings, and he apologized instantly. \""I... we... we didn't mean to do that. It's just -- you are so beautiful, dear.

We are the most powerful person in all of Tamriel, and... Barenziah, we... I... I think I am the most lonely as well.\"" He stood up suddenly. \""Power!\"" he said with sublime contempt. \""I'd trade a goodly share of it for youth and love if the gods would only sanction it.\""""},{""text1"":""\""But you are strong and vigorous and vital, more than any man I've ever known.\""""},{""text1"":""He shook his head vehemently. \""Today, perhaps.

Have you not noticed the coolness of the Empress and her son toward you?\""""},{""text1"":""Barenziah shrugged. Even before she and Septim had become lovers, she'd received no more from his family than bare civility. Threadbare civility. \""What matter? It is Tiber who holds the power.\""""},{""text1"":""\""But it is his son who holds the future. Do not put his mother up to public scorn, I beg you.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Can I help it if that dry stick of a woman cannot hold her husband's interest even in conversation at dinner?\""""},{""text1"":""\""Have less to say in public. That is all I ask. She matters little, it is true -- but her children love her, and you do not want them as enemies. Tiber Septim has not long to live. I mean,\"" Drelliane amended quickly at Barenziah's scowl, \""humans are all short-lived. Ephemeral, as we of the Elder Races say. They come and go as the seasons -- but the families of the powerful ones live on for a time. You must be a friend to this family if you would see lasting profit from your relationship. Ah, but how can I make you see truly, you who are so young and human-bred as well! If you take heed, and wisely, you and Mournhold are like to live to see the fall of Septim's dynasty, if indeed he has founded one, just as you have witnessed its rise. It is the way of human history. They ebb and flow like the inconstant tides. Their cities and dominions bloom like spring flowers, only to wither and die in the summer sun. But the Elves endure. We are as a year to their hour, a decade to their day.\""""},{""text1"":""Barenziah just laughed. She knew that rumors abounded about her and Tiber Septim. She enjoyed the attention, for all save the Empress and her son seemed captivated by her. Minstrels sang of her dark beauty and her charming ways. She was in fashion, and in love -- and if it was temporary, well, what was not? She was happy for the first time she could remember, each of her days filled with joy and pleasure. And the nights were even better.""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""\""What is wrong with me?\"" Barenziah lamented. \""Look, not one of my skirts fit. What's become of my waistline? Am I getting fat?\"" Barenziah regarded her thin arms and legs and her undeniably thickened waist in the mirror with displeasure.""},{""text1"":""Drelliane shrugged. \""You appear to be with child, young as you are. Constant pairing with a human has brought you to early fertility. I see no choice but for you to speak with the Emperor about it. You are in his power. It would be best, I think, for you to go directly to Mournhold if he would agree to it, and bear the child there.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Alone?\"" Barenziah placed her hands on her swollen belly, tears forming in her eyes. Everything in her yearned to share the fruit of her love with her lover. \""He'll never agree to that. He won't be parted from me now. You'll see.\""""},{""text1"":""Drelliane shook her head. Although she said no more, a look of sympathy and sorrow had replaced her usual cool scorn.""},{""text1"":""That night Barenziah told Tiber Septim when he came to her for their usual assignation.""},{""text1"":""\""With child?\"" He looked shocked. No, stunned. \""You're sure of it? But I was told Elves do not bear at so young an age...\""""},{""text1"":""Barenziah forced a smile. \""How can I be sure? I've never--\""""},{""text1"":""\""I shall have my healer fetched.\""""},{""text1"":""The healer, a High Elf of middle years, confirmed that Barenziah was indeed pregnant, and that such a thing had never before been known to happen.

She never reached it. Darkness overtook her.""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""She awoke to pain, and a feeling of emptiness. A void where something used to be, something that used to be alive, but now was dead and gone forever. Drelliane was there to soothe the pain and clean up the blood that still pooled at times between her legs. But there was nothing to fill the emptiness. There was nothing to take the place of the void.""},{""text1"":""The Emperor sent magnificent gifts and vast arrangements of flowers, and came on short visits, always well-attended. Barenziah received these visits with pleasure at first. But Tiber Septim came no more at night -- and after some time nor did she wish him to.""},{""text1"":""Some weeks passed, and when she was completely physically recovered, Drelliane informed her that Symmachus had written to request she come to Mournhold earlier than planned. It was announced that she would leave forthwith.""},{""text1"":""She was given a grand retinue, an extensive trousseau befitting a queen, and an elaborate and impressive ceremonial departure from the gates of the Imperial City.

Dearly have I bought it. Now I do understand better Tiber Septim's love of it, if he has often paid such prices. For surely worth is measured by the price we pay.\"" By her wish, she rode on a shiny roan mare, clad as a warrior in resplendent chain mail of Dark Elven make.""},{""text1"":""As the days slowly slipped by and her train rode the winding road eastward into the setting sun, around her gradually rose the steep-sided mountain slopes of Morrowind. The air was thin, and a chill late autumn wind blew constantly. But it was also rich with the sweet spicy smell of the late-blooming black rose, which was native to Morrowind and grew in every shadowy nook and crevice of its highlands, finding nourishment even in the stoniest banks and ridges. In small villages and towns, ragged Dark Elven folk gathered along the road to cry her name or simply gape. Most of her knightly escort were Redguards, with a few High Elves, Nords, and Bretons. As they wove their way into the heart of Morrowind, they grew increasingly uncomfortable and clung together in protective clusters. Even the Elven knights seemed wary.""},{""text1"":""But Barenziah felt at home, at last. She felt the welcome extended to her by the land. Her land.""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""Symmachus met her at the Mournhold border with an escort of knights, about half of whom were Dark Elven. In Imperial battle dress, she noted.""},{""text1"":""There was a grand parade of entry into the city and speeches of welcome from stately dignitaries.""},{""text1"":""\""I've had the queen's suite refurbished for you,\"" the general told her later when they reached the palace, \""but you may change anything not to your taste, of course.\"" He went on about the details of the coronation, which was to be held in a week. He was his old commanding self -- but she sensed something else as well. He was eager for her approval of the arrangements, was in fact fishing for it. That was new. He had never required her commendation before.""},{""text1"":""He asked her nothing about her stay in the Imperial City, or of her affair with Tiber Septim -- although Barenziah was certain Drelliane had told him, or earlier written him, everything in detail.""},{""text1"":""The ceremony itself, like so much else, was a mixture of old and new -- parts of it from the ancient Dark Elven tradition of Mournhold, the others dictated by Imperial decree. She was sworn to the service of the Empire and Tiber Septim as well as to the land of Mournhold and its people. She accepted oaths of fealty and allegiance from the people, the nobility, and the council. This last was composed of a blend of Imperial emissaries (\""advisors\"" they were called) and native representatives of the Mournhold people, who were mostly elders in accordance with Elven custom.""},{""text1"":""Barenziah later found that much of her time was occupied in attempting to reconcile these two factions and their cronies. The elders were expected to do most of the conciliating, in light of reforms introduced by the Empire pertaining to land ownership and surface farming. But most of these went clean against Dark Elven observances. Tiber Septim, \""in the name of the One,\"" had ordained a new tradition -- and apparently even the gods and goddesses themselves were expected to obey.""},{""text1"":""The new Queen threw herself into her work and her studies. She was through with love and men for a long, long time -- if not forever. There were other pleasures, she discovered, as Symmachus had promised her long ago: those of the mind, and those of power. She developed (surprisingly, for she had always rebelled against her tutors at the Imperial City) a deep love for Dark Elven history and mythology, a hunger to know more fully the people from whom she had sprung. She was gratified to learn that they had been proud warriors and skilled craftsmen and cunning mages since time immemorial.""},{""text1"":""Tiber Septim lived for another half-century, during which she saw him on several occasions as she was bidden to the Imperial City on one reason of state or another. He greeted her with warmth during these visits, and they even had long talks together about events in the Empire when opportunity would permit. He seemed to have quite forgotten that there had ever been anything between them more than easy friendship and a profound political alliance. He changed little as the years passed. Rumor had it that his mages had developed spells to extend his vitality, and that even the One had granted him immortality. Then one day a messenger came with the news that Tiber Septim was dead, and his grandson Pelagius was now Emperor in his place.""},{""text1"":""They had heard the news in private, she and Symmachus. The sometime Imperial General and now her trusted Prime Minister took it stoically, as he took most everything.""},{""text1"":""\""Somehow it doesn't seem possible,\"" Barenziah said.""},{""text1"":""\""I told you. Ai. It's the way of humans. They are a short-lived people. It doesn't really matter. His power lives on, and his son now wields it.\""""},{""text1"":""\""You called him your friend once.

I know,\"" he said softly, taking her hand. \""Barenziah...\"" He turned her face up and kissed her.""},{""text1"":""The act filled her with astonishment. She couldn't remember his ever touching her before. She'd never thought of him in that way -- and yet, undeniably, an old familiar warmth spread through her. She'd forgotten how good it felt, that warmth. Not the scorching heat she'd felt with Tiber Septim, but the comforting, robust ardor she somehow associated with... with Straw! Straw. Poor Straw. She hadn't thought of him in so long. He'd be middle-aged now if he were still alive. Probably with a dozen children, she thought affectionately... and a hearty wife who hopefully could talk for two.""},{""text1"":""\""Marry me, Barenziah,\"" Symmachus was saying, he seemed to have picked up her thoughts on marriage, children... wives, \""I've worked and toiled and waited long enough, haven't I?\""""},{""text1"":""Marriage.

If not Symmachus, who else?""},{""text1"":""Many of the great noble families of Morrowind had been wiped out in Tiber Septim's great war of unification, before the treaty. Dark Elven rule had been restored, it was true -- but not the old, not the true nobility. Most of them were upstarts like Symmachus, and not even half as good or deserving as he was. He had fought to keep Mournhold whole and hale when their so-called counselors would have picked at its bones, sucked them dry as Ebonheart had been sucked dry. He'd fought for Mournhold, fought for her, while she and the kingdom grew and thrived. She felt a sudden rush of gratitude -- and, undeniably, affection. He was steady and reliable. And he'd served her well. And loved her well.""},{""text1"":""\""Why not?\"" she said, smiling. And took his hand. And kissed him.""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":"" ""},{""text1"":""The union was a good one, in its political as well as personal aspects. While Tiber Septim's grandson, the Emperor Pelagius I, viewed her with a jaundiced eye, his trust in his father's old friend was absolute.""},{""text1"":""Symmachus, however, was still viewed with suspicion by Morrowind's stiff-necked folk, chary at his peasant ancestry and his close ties to the Empire. But the Queen was quite unshakably popular. \""The Lady Barenziah's one of our own,\"" it was whispered, \""held captive as we.\""""},{""text1"":""Barenziah felt content. There was work and there was pleasure -- and what more could one ask of life?""},{""text1"":""The years passed swiftly, with crises to be dealt with, and storms and famines and failures to be weathered, and plots to be foiled, and conspirators to be executed. Mournhold prospered steadily. Her people were secure and fed, her mines and farms productive. All was well -- save that the royal marriage had produced  no children. No heirs. \nElven children are slow to come, and most demanding of their welcome -- and noble children more so than others. Thus many decades had come to pass before they grew concerned.""},{""text1"":""\""The fault lies with me, Symmachus. I'm damaged goods,\"" Barenziah said bitterly. \""If you want to take another...\""""},{""text1"":""\""I want no other,\"" Symmachus said gently, \""nor do I know for certain that the fault is yours. Perhaps it is mine. Ai. Whichever. We will seek a cure. If there is damage, surely it may be repaired.\""""},{""text1"":""\""How so? When we dare not entrust anyone with the true story?

With Elves there was always time. \nBarenziah sat at dinner in the Great Hall, pushing food about on a plate, feeling bored and restless. Symmachus was away, having been summoned to the Imperial City by Tiber Septim's great-great-grandson, Uriel Septim. Or was it his great-great-great-grandson? She'd lost count, she realized. Their faces seemed to blur one into the next. Perhaps she should have gone with him, but there'd been the delegation from Tear on a tiresome matter that nevertheless required delicate handling.""},{""text1"":""A bard was singing in an alcove off the hall, but Barenziah wasn't listening. Lately all the songs seemed the same to her, whether new or old. Then a turn of phrase caught her attention. He was singing of freedom, of adventure, of freeing Morrowind from its chains. How dare he! Barenziah sat up straight and turned to glare at him. Worse, she realized he was singing of some ancient, and now immaterial, war with the Skyrim Nords, praising the heroism of Kings Edward and Moraelyn and their brave Companions. The tale was old enough, certainly, yet the song was new ... and its meaning ... Barenziah couldn't be sure.""},{""text1"":""A bold fellow, this bard, but with a strong, passionate voice and a good ear for music. Rather handsome too, in a raffish sort of way.

That the Queen had been badly shaken by the encounter and deeply mourned the loss of her friend, who had fallen in her defense.

Then he turned serious once more. \""Ai! He knew the Staff lay there, not the Horn, and that he must teleport to safety. The Staff is not a weapon that would have seen him clear, unlike the Horn. Praise the gods at least that he does not have that! It seems all was as he expected -- but how did he know? I placed the Staff there myself, with the aid of the ragtail end of the Ra'athim Clan who now sits king in Castle Ebonheart as a reward. Tiber Septim claimed the Horn, but left the Staff for safekeeping. Ai! Now the Nightingale can use the Staff to sow seeds of strife and dissension wherever he goes, if he wishes.

Human blood seems to be the one missing component in Tharn's ancestry.\"" To Symmachus, Barenziah knew, that was a flaw. Her husband despised Wood Elves as lazy thieves and High Elves as effete intellectuals. But he admired humans, especially Bretons, for their combination of pragmatism, intelligence, and energy. \""The Nightingale's of Ebonheart, of the Ra'athim Clan - House Hlaalu, the House of Mora in particular, I'll be bound.

Ebonheart was jealous that the Staff was laid here when Tiber Septim took the Horn of Summoning from us.\""""},{""text1"":""Barenziah sighed a little. The rivalry between Ebonheart and Mournhold reached back almost to the dawn of Morrowind's history. Once the two nations had been one, all the lucrative mines held in fief by the Ra'athims, whose nobility retained the High Kingship of Morrowind. Ebonheart had split into two separate city-states, Ebonheart and Mournhold, when Queen Lian's twin sons -- grandsons of the legendary King Moraelyn -- were left as joint heirs. At about the same time the office of High King was vacated in favor of a temporary War Leader to be named by a council in times of provincial emergency.""},{""text1"":""Still, Ebonheart remained jealous of her prerogatives as the eldest city-state of Morrowind (\""first among equals\"" was the phrase its rulers often quoted) and claimed that rightful guardianship of the Staff of Chaos should have been entrusted to its ruling house. Mournhold responded that King Moraelyn himself had placed the Staff in the keeping of the god Ephen -- and Mournhold was unarguably the god's birthplace.""},{""text1"":""\""Why not tell Jagar Tharn of your suspicions, then? Let him recover the thing. As long as it's safe, what does it matter who recovers it, or where it lies?\""""},{""text1"":""Symmachus stared at her without comprehension. \""It matters,\"" he said softly after a while, \""but I suppose not that much.

Nothing more was heard of the Staff of Chaos, or the Nightingale.

He was much like his father, whom he worshipped. When Helseth was eight years old Barenziah bore a second child, a daughter, to Symmachus' lasting delight. Helseth was his pride, but little Morgiah -- named for Symmachus' mother -- held his heart.""},{""text1"":""Sadly, the birth of Morgiah was not the harbinger of better times ahead. Relations with the Empire slowly deteriorated, for no apparent reason. Taxes were raised and quotas increased with each passing year. Symmachus felt that the Emperor suspected him of having had a hand in the Staff's disappearance and sought to prove his loyalty by making every effort to comply with the escalating demands. He lengthened working hours and raised tariffs, and even made up some of the difference from both the royal exchequer and their own private holdings. But the levies multiplied, and commoners and nobles alike began to complain. It was an ominous rumble.""},{""text1"":""\""I want you to take the children and journey to the Imperial City,\"" Symmachus said at last in desperation one evening after dinner. \""You must make the Emperor listen, else all Mournhold will be up in revolt come spring.\"" He grinned forcibly. \""You have a way with men, love.

Your appointment is for next week. No, see...\"" And now it wasn't even going well. The Emperor did not even make the slightest pretence at listening to her. He hadn't invited her to sit, nor had he dismissed the children. Helseth stood still as a carven image, but little Morgiah had begun to fuss.""},{""text1"":""The state of her own mind didn't help her any. Shortly upon arrival at her lodgings, the Mournholdian ambassador to the Imperial City had demanded entry, bringing with him a sheaf of dispatches from Symmachus. Bad news, and plenty of it. The revolt had finally begun. The peasants had organized around a few disgruntled members of Mournhold's minor nobility, and were demanding Symmachus step down and hand over the reins of government. Only the Imperial Guard and a handful of troops whose families had been retainers of Barenziah's house for generations stood between Symmachus and the rabble. Hostilities had already broken out, but apparently Symmachus was safe and still in control. Not for long, he wrote. He entreated Barenziah to try her best with the Emperor -- but in any case she was to stay in the Imperial City until he wrote to tell her it was safe to go back home with the children.""},{""text1"":""She had tried to barge her way through the Imperial bureaucracy -- with little success. And to add to her growing panic, all news from Mournhold had come to a sudden stop. Tottering between rage at the Emperor's numerous major-domos and fear of the fate awaiting her and her family, the weeks had passed by tensely, agonizingly, remorselessly. Then one day the Mournholdian ambassador came calling to tell her she should expect news from Symmachus the following night at the latest, not through the regular channels but by nighthawk. Seemingly by the same stroke of luck, she was informed that same day by a clerk from the Imperial Court that Uriel Septim had finally consented to grant her an audience early on the morrow.""},{""text1"":""The Emperor had greeted the three of them when they came into the audience chamber with a too-bright smile of welcome that nonetheless didn't reach his eyes. Then, as she presented her children, he had gazed at them with a fixed attention that was real yet somehow inappropriate. Barenziah had been dealing with humans for nearly five hundred years now, and had developed the skill of reading their expressions and movements that was far beyond what any human could ever perceive. Try as the Emperor might to conceal it, there was hunger in his eyes -- and something else. Regret? Yes. Regret. But why? He had several fine children of his own. Why covet hers? And why look at her with such a vicious -- however brief -- yearning? Perhaps he had tired of his consort. Humans were notoriously, though predictably, inconstant. After that one long, burning glance, his gaze had shifted away as she began to speak of her mission and the violence that had erupted in Mournhold. He sat still as stone throughout her entire account.""},{""text1"":""Puzzled at his inertia, and vexed no end, Barenziah stared into the pale, set face, looking for some trace of the Septims she'd known in the past. She didn't know Uriel Septim well, having met him once when he was still a child, and then again at his coronation twenty years later. Twice, that was all. He'd been a stern and dignified presence at the ceremony, even as a young adult -- yet not icily remote as this more mature man was. In fact, despite the physical resemblance, he didn't seem to be the same man at all. Not the same, yet something about him was familiar to her, more familiar than it should be, some trick of posture or gesture...""},{""text1"":""Suddenly she felt very hot, as if lava had been poured over her. Illusion! She had studied the arts of illusion well since the Nightingale had deceived her so badly. She had learned to detect it -- and she felt it now, as certainly as a blind man could feel the sun on his face. Illusion! But why? Her mind worked furiously even as her mouth went on reciting details about Mournhold's troubles. Vanity? Humans were oft as ashamed at the signs of ageing as Elves were proud to exhibit them. Yet the face Uriel Septim wore seemed consistent with his age.""},{""text1"":""Barenziah dared use none of her own magic. Even petty nobles had means of detecting magicka, if not actually shielding themselves from its effects, within their own halls. The use of sorcery here would bring down the Emperor's wrath as surely as drawing a dagger would.""},{""text1"":""Magic.""},{""text1"":""Illusion.""},{""text1"":""Suddenly she was brought to mind of the Nightingale. And then he was sitting before her. Then the vision changed, and it was Uriel Septim. He looked sad. Trapped. And then the vision faded once more, and another man sat in his place, like the Nightingale, and yet unlike. Pale skin, bloodshot eyes, Elven ears -- and about him a fierce glow of concentrated malice, an aura of eldritch energy -- a horrible, destructive shimmer. This man was capable of anything!""},{""text1"":""And then once again she was looking into the face of Uriel Septim.""},{""text1"":""How could she be sure she wasn't imagining things? Perhaps her mind was playing tricks on her. She felt a sudden vast weariness, as if she'd been carrying a heavy burden too long and too far. She decided to abandon her earnest narrative of Mournhold's ills -- as it was quite plainly getting her nowhere -- and switch back to pleasantry. Pleasantry, however, with a hidden agenda.""},{""text1"":""\""Do you remember, Sire, Symmachus and I had dinner with your family shortly after your father's coronation? You were no older than tiny Morgiah here. We were greatly honored to be the only guests that evening -- except for your best friend Justin, of course.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Ah yes,\"" the Emperor said, smiling cautiously. Very cautiously. \""I do believe I recall that.\""""},{""text1"":""\""You and Justin were such friends, Your Majesty. I was told he died not long after. A great pity.\""""},{""text1"":""\""Indeed. I still do not like to speak of him.\"" His eyes turned blank -- or blanker, if it had been possible. \""As for your request, Milady, we shall take it under advisement and let you know.\""""},{""text1"":""Barenziah bowed, as did the children. A nod from the Emperor dismissed them, and they backed away from the imperial presence.""},{""text1"":""She took a deep breath when they emerged from the throne room. \""Justin\"" had been an imaginary playmate, although young Uriel had insisted a place be set for Justin at every meal. Not only that, Justin, despite the boyish name, had been a girl! Symmachus had kept up the joke long after she had gone the way of imaginary childhood friends -- inquiring after Justin's health whenever he and Uriel Septim met, and being responded to in as mock-serious a fashion. The last Barenziah had heard of Justin, several years ago, the Emperor had evidently joked elaborately to Symmachus that she had met an adventurous though incorrigible Khajiit youth, married him, and settled down in Lilandril to raise fire ferns and mugworts.""},{""text1"":""The man sitting on the Emperor's divan was not Uriel Septim!

Symmachus had been wrong, so wrong...""},{""text1"":""What now? she wondered frantically. What had become of Uriel Septim -- and more to the point, what did it mean for her and Symmachus, and all of Mournhold? Thinking back, Barenziah guessed that their troubles were due to this false Emperor, this Nightingale-spawned glamour -- or whatever he really was. He must have taken Uriel Septim's place shortly before the unreasonable demands on Mournhold had begun. That would explain why relations had deteriorated for so long (as humans reckoned time), long after her disapproved liaison with Tiber Septim. The Nightingale knew of Symmachus' famed loyalty to, and knowledge of, the Septim House, and was effecting a pre-emptive strike. If that were the case, they were all in terrible danger. She and the children were in his power here in the Imperial City, and Symmachus was left alone to deal with troubles of the Nightingale's brewing in Mournhold.""},{""text1"":""What must she do? Barenziah impelled the children ahead of her, a hand on each shoulder, trying to stay cool, collected, her ladies-in-waiting and personal knights escort trailing behind. Finally they reached their waiting carriage. Even though their suite of rooms was only a few blocks from the Palace, royal dignity forbade travel on foot for even short distances -- and for once, Barenziah was glad of it. The carriage seemed a kind of refuge now, false as she knew the feeling must be.""},{""text1"":""A boy dashed up to one of the guards and handed him a scroll, then pointed toward the carriage. The guard brought it to her. The boy waited, eyes wide and shining.

She wanted only to leave this city! Certainly she had no inclination toward any dalliance with a dazzled human. She looked up, frowning, and one of the guards said, \""Milady, the boy says his master awaits your reply yonder.\"" She looked in the direction indicated and saw a handsome elderly man on horseback, surrounded by a half dozen courtiers and cavaliers. He caught her eye and bowed respectfully, taking off a plumed hat.""},{""text1"":""\""Very well,\"" Barenziah said to the boy on impulse. \""Tell your master he may call on me tonight, after the dinner hour.\"" King Eadwyre looked polite and grave, and rather worried -- but not in the least lovestruck. At least that was something, she thought pensively. \nBarenziah stood at the tower window, waiting. She could sense the familiar's nearness. But though the night sky was clear as day to her eyes, she could not yet see him. Then suddenly he was there, a swift moving dot beneath the wispy night clouds. A few more minutes and the great nighthawk finished its descent, wings folding, talons reaching for her thick leather armband.""},{""text1"":""She carried the bird to its perch, where it waited, panting, as her impatient fingers felt for the message secured in a capsule on one leg. The hawk drank mightily from the water till when she had done, then ruffled its feathers and preened, secure in her presence.

She had chosen a Champion who would undertake to find the Staff of Chaos, which had been hidden by the traitorous sorcerer in an unknown site. This Champion was to wield the Staff's power to destroy Jagar Tharn, who was otherwise invulnerable, and rescue the true Emperor being held prisoner in another dimension. However, the Champion, while thankfully still alive, now languished in the Imperial Dungeons. Tharn's attention must be diverted while the chosen one gained freedom with Ria's spirit's help.

She in her turn did not love him -- but she was fond of him, and that was something. It was nice to have someone, and Wayrest was a very good place, a good place for children to grow up, while they waited, and bided their time, and prayed for the Champion's success in his mission.""},{""text1"":""Barenziah could only hope that he wouldn't take very long, whoever this unnamed Champion was.

She had no doubt it was going to be a long life yet. And during it she wanted peace, and quiet, and serenity, of her soul as well as of her heart. Peasant dreams. That was what she wanted.
