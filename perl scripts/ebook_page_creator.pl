######################### Program Statement #########################	 
# The ebook_page_creator program is designed easily convert mysql entries into
# properly formated ebook html pages.

##################### How To Use ##################################
# The program has been compiled and tested on Windows 10 using Strawberry Perl. 
#	
#	Steps: 
#   1. Open command prompt 
#	2. Change directory to where ebook_page_creator.pl is located
#	3. Enter perl ebook_page_creator.pl into command prompt
#	4. When prompted enter the start ID for the codex
#	5. When prompted enter the end ID for the codex 
#	6. Files will now be created and located in the ebook_page_creator.pl folder
#

####################### Algorithm Design #######################

# The algorithm below works through an for loop structure. The user will input the start and stop codex ID. 
# Within the loop the proper query will be created and executed pulling the proper information and outputing it to
# the file.
# The exact step by step implementation is below.

# 1. The program is executed.
# 2. User will be prompted to enter start ID.
# 3. User will be prompted to enter end ID.
# 4. For loop is executed.
#	4.1) Query is prepared and executed
#	4.2) The file name (aka codex title) will be stripped of any possible invalid characters,
#		 that would prevent the file from being created
#   4.3) Codex Text is stripped of newline characters and replaced the <p></p> 
#	4.4) File is opened/created
#	4.5) Text is written to file
#	4.6) File is closed
# 5. Step 4 repeats until end ID is reached.
