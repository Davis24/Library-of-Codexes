SPLIT: ...chosen to explore this relation of world to shadow, Azra was the first to realize that shadows were not a mere absence of light, but a reflection of possible worlds created by forces in conflict. A light strikes a rock, and the shadow is a record of their clash, past, present and future. Other conflicting forces produced less obvious shadows, fire and water, wind and rock, or nations at war. With skill and patience the shadows of all could be read, and patterns teased out, emphasized or eradicated. Manipulating a shadow could, through contagion, manipulate the object or force which cast it. Azra was eminent master of this nearly imperceptible magic.

SPLIT: My most estimable Lakvan, You must understand you risk my wrath by continued association with this Pergan Asuul. Your claim he is a Shadomage opposed to Skelos Undriel is irrelevant. Shadow magics by their nature will twist on their casters and so do the words  of the magic's practitioners. My plan to have utterly destroy Undriel can tolerate no such risk this close to fruition. End your association with Pergan Asuul or I shall end mine with you. Ponder that choice as you will.

Sincerely, Jagar Tharn.

SPLIT: ...Azra attempted what had never been done before, manipulating his own  shadow to such and extent that he instantiated and melded all possible  Azras at the same time, crossing over from this singular existences in  shadow. Ignorant Redguard soldier, fearing the power of Azra should he  succeed, trapped and confronted Azra. The battle did not go well for the  wizard. The hole blasted when he lost control of his magics can still  be seen at the village that bears his name, Azra's Crossing. The science  of shadow lost a great man that day, although others, such as Pergan  Asuul, strive to take his place.
