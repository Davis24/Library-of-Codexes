A light strikes a rock, and the shadow is a record of their clash, past, present and future. Other conflicting forces produced less obvious shadows, fire and water, wind and rock, or nations at war. With skill and patience the shadows of all could be read, and patterns teased out, emphasized or eradicated. Manipulating a shadow could, through contagion, manipulate the object or force which cast it. Azra was eminent master of this nearly imperceptible magic.""}]"

Your claim he is a Shadomage opposed to Skelos Undriel is irrelevant. Shadow magics by their nature will twist on their casters and so do the words of the magic's practitioners. My plan to have utterly destroy Undriel can tolerate no such risk this close to fruition. End your association with Pergan Asuul or I shall end mine with you. Ponder that choice as you will.""},{""text"":""Sincerely, Jagar Tharn.""}]"

Ignorant Redguard soldier, fearing the power of Azra should he  succeed, trapped and confronted Azra. The battle did not go well for the  wizard. The hole blasted when he lost control of his magics can still  be seen at the village that bears his name, Azra's Crossing. The science  of shadow lost a great man that day, although others, such as Pergan  Asuul, strive to take his place.""}]"
