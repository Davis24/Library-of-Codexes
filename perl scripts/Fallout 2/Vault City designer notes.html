<p> Vault City went trough many incarnations. It was designed by Leonard Boyarsky, Jason Anderson, Feargus Urquhart, and Chris Avellone. Scott Everts built the maps, and the brave men who scripted this architectural Frankenstein were Rob Hertenstein and Dan Spitzley. And finally, Eric Pribish nearly gave his life testing the monstrosity that is Vault City.<br /><br><br /><br>Chris would like to thank the following people who helped during the production of Fallout 2: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game|Fallout 2:<br /><br><br /><br>Rob, Scotty, and Dan (of course), Eileen Suh, Sarah Smart, Emily Yance, Thuy Dang (who I never thank for anything), Chris Wright, and Tim Winkle.<br /><br><br /><br>Scotty would like to thank the following people:<br /><br><br /><br>Don & Aileen Everts and Avis Andre.
