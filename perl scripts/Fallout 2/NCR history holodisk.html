<p> <b>New California Republic Information Disk 5</b><br /><br><br /><br>We're Here! Why not join us?<br /><br><br /><br>There's a wonderful future ahead - and it could be yours with the New California Republic!<br /><br><br /><br>But what is it, you want to know?<br /><br><br /><br><b>How big is NCR?</b><br /><br><br /><br>Founded eighty years ago, the NCR is now comprised of the states of Shady, Los Angeles, Maxson, Hub, and Dayglow. Approximately 700,000 citizens are pleased to call NCR home.<br /><br><br /><br><b>What does NCR stand for?</b><br /><br><br /><br>The New California Republic is dedicated to bringing peace, security and justice to the people of the great west. NCR's fine police forces constantly patrol and arrest any raiders, cannibals, slavers, and lawless mutants within the country, and the NCR army valiantly protects the borders against outside marauders. To ensure justice and liberty, all citizens have access to NCR's courts and the right to vote for a representative of their choice to sit in the Hall of Congress. In the words of President Tandi "A safe people is a strong people."<br /><br><br /><br><b>Who's in charge here?</b><br /><br><br /><br>NCR may be a bit different from what you're used to. There are no chieftains, town bosses, kings, or dictators here. Our leaders are elected by the people! That's right -- every state has the right to send representatives to the Hall of Congress. These representatives select the President and Vice-President to head the council and it is their advice which guides the President's decisions. For ten terms now, President Tandi has been the unanimous choice of the council, who respect her wisdom and foresight.<br /><br><br /><br><b>Sounds great! How do I join the NCR?</b><br /><br><br /><br>All law-abiding and peaceful people, human or mutant, are eligible to become citizens of NCR. To become a citizen all you have to do is move to NCR and present your claim for immigration. After citizenship training and processing your application, you will be notified of your new status as a PC (Provisional Citizen). From there, it's only a short step to full citizenship!<br /><br><br /><br>Of course, NCR is not for everybody - slavers, unreformed mutants, known raiders, and other undesirables need not apply!<br /><br><br /><br><b>But what if my entire town wants to join?</b><br /><br><br /><br>Depending on where your town is located, NCR does accept petitions by villages, towns, bases, city-states, even minor kingdoms for annexation by NCR. Once the petition is accepted, NCR will grant your town territorial status. Once the needed police and army presence is established and any banditry or other lawlessness has been dealt with, your village can apply for full statehood in the NCR. It's that simple!<br /><br><br /><br><b>So remember - We're here. Why not join us?</b><br /><br><br /><br>Prepared by the New California Relations Advisory Panel<br /><br><br /><br>NCRAP Pub. #A7-7893b<br /><br><br /><br>This page was intentionally left blank. </p>
