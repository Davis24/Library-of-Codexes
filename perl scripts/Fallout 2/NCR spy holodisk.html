<p> This disk seems to be filled with reports about NCR - monthly production totals, caravan schedules, security rosters, minutes of Congressional hearings, secret council reports, diplomatic correspondence from New Reno, Redding, and Vault City, even several weeks worth of President Tandi&#39;s appointment schedule. There&#39;s nothing here about Vault 13 or a GECK, though. All the reports are addressed to Darion and are signed &quot;F-&quot;. </p>
