In a financial coup, the US managed to be the first to tap the world's last remaining supply of oil. Until recently this reserve of oil was thought to be unattainable due to the deposit being located thousands of feet beneath the surface of the Pacific Ocean. With the world's supply of oil nearing depletion, a race to be the first to create a method to extract this deposit ensued. We at the GNN are proud to announce that US is the first to do so and thus claim the oil as property of the United States. Way to go US!<br /><br><br /><br>China cries foul as news of the success circulates around the globe. According to President Xin of China, their drilling platform project was scheduled for completion months before the US project, however the Chinese platform had a string of unfortunate accidents delaying their project significantly. President Xin is also quoted in saying that he has definitive proof that the US was behind the sabotage of their oil platform and formally requests that an international panel be appointed to investigate.<br /><br><br /><br>In other news, riots rock the nation as gasoline prices skyrocket to all time highs.
