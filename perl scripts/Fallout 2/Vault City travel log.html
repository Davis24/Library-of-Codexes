Never eat any food offered by an Outsider, as you introduce bacteria or radioactive particles into your system!<br>    A Geiger counter.

The slightest cut or nick could introduce harmful bacteria into your system!<br><br><br>Redding<br><br>    Redding: Small mining community located west of Vault City. Redding trades gold ore for medical supplies from Vault City. All Vault Citizens are encouraged to exercise extreme caution when traveling inside Redding, as the provincial miners are not strongly governed.<br>    Population: A census is unavailable, but Redding is believed to have hundreds of residents.<br>    Government: Mayor and town council.<br>    Background radiation count: Current readings are unavailable.<br>    Mutation rate: Unknown, believed low.<br><br><br>New Reno<br><br>    New Reno: City southwest of Vault City. Trades gold ore for medical supplies from Vault City. Reno suffered little structural damage during the war (though looting and property damage have taken their toll), so many streets and buildings remain intact. Warning! There is no central government and no law enforcement. Gambling, prostitution, and drug use are rampant. Vault Citizens are warned to avoid New Reno at ALL costs!<br>    Population: No current census, but believed to be several thousand..."people".<br>    Government: New Reno presently exists in a state of near-anarchy. According to reports, several "crime families" have divided the city amongst themselves.<br>    Background radiation count: Current readings are unavailable.<br>    Mutation rate: Unknown, believed low.<br><br><br>New California Republic<br><br>    New California Republic: The territories of NCR are located far to the south of Vault City.

The ore is traded to Vault City in exchange for medical supplies, mostly Rad-X and RadAway. Humans are believed to be forced to live with mutants and ghouls within the town. Due to the nature of the inhabitants and the high probability of contamination, Vault Citizens should avoid Broken Hills at ALL costs!<br>    Population: No current census, but believed to be in the hundreds of residents.<br>    Government: Rumor has it a MUTANT serves as the First Citizen of this community. This is extremely unlikely, as most mutants are incapable of higher reasoning. If this rumor IS true, it is another reason to avoid Broken Hills altogether.<br>    Background radiation count: Current readings are unavailable. Believed high.<br>    Mutation rate: Believed high. Broken Hills most likely has a high rate of degenerative mutations.<br><br><br>Vault City<br><br>    Vault City: This utopia is free from crimes and other sociological ills that inflict the other communities in Northern California.
