Ghost Fragment: Jupiter
Card: Jupiter , Points: 5
Lord of worlds, massive Jupiter and its moons must have been a cornerstone of Golden Age
civilization. But the nature and extent of human presence there is now unknown. Old records refer to
cities in ice and worldspanning
oceans, but perhaps this is only poetry.
The City's ships have rarely attempted any journey to Jupiter or beyond.

Dreams of Alpha Lupi
Even the largest body lets itself be pushed where it needs to be, seduced into nice, warm loving
orbits. Persistence is the key.
Seafloors transform and then yank themselves skyward, shattering the icy crust. New worlds awaken
in the swirling depths.
You build homes around this halfborn
sun ripped by storms and supersonic wind.
