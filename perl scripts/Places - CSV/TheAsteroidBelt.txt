Card: The Asteroid Belt , Points: 5
"The Belt is the key to everything."
The Asteroid Belt is a great band of nothingness, speckled with unimaginable wealth. Once a treasure
trove for Golden Age industry, the Belt is now a haunted place where Fallen pirates and Awoken
patrols skirmish among the whispering carcasses of ancient machines.
Among the asteroids drifts the Reef, lashed together from the ruined ships of an ancient exodus. Here
the Queen rules over the Awoken the
farthest known light of civilization.
Card: The Reef , Points: 5
"Intruder bearing onetwoseven.
You have crossed into the realm of the Awoken. State your
business, or be fired upon by order of the Queen."
The fate of those escaping Earth during the Collapse was once unknown. But here drifts a graveyard
of lost ships, and among them the
Realm of the Awoken. Ruled by a Queen few have seen, they
have long avoided contact with the City.
