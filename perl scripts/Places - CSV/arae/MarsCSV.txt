Ghost Fragment: Mars '','' Dreams of Alpha Lupi\n\nLife waits inside this world's bones.\n\nYour voice flows across the red rock and through the dead valleys, speaking in code and goads.\n\nAncient volcanoes swell, exploding at their peaks and splitting wide along their shoulders. Ash clouds blacken the starved air. A fossil ocean of ice softens and collapses. Geysers erupt, tall as mountains, throwing up steam and clouds.\n\nEvery moment matters. And from a great distance, in the midst of a thousand careful disasters, you watch the transformation with your own eyes.\n\nThe rose has blossomed.
Ghost Fragment: Meridian Bay '','' We want your grandchildren.\n\nDoes that sound grim? Don't panic. We aren't talking about human babies, yours or anyone else's.\n\nWe're talking about your inventions. The children of your mind.\n\nCome join us. Come to Clovis Bray and build the laboratory of your dreams. Anything you need.\n\nDemand it and it's yours. At Clovis Bray, we have a singular understanding of genius, and we appreciate how brilliant minds flourish when they enjoy total freedom.\n\nThis is Freehold, the realm where the new and the best is born. This is where your brilliance, freed of budget constraints and managers, makes the universe dance.\n\nClovis Bray is a nursery, a nursery to a million marvels. Your inventions belong to no one but you.\n\nCherish them, praise them. Or tell them they aren't worthy and set them inside a deep dark drawer.\n\nBut as every parent soon learns, children grow up. And every technology matures. At some point, your inventions are going to find mates. They'll join with other marvels and produce a new generation of offspring.\n\nMaybe you'll build a better reactor.\n\nMeanwhile, the genius in the lab next door devises an elegant way to fold machines into tiny spaces.\n\nYour device meets hers, and a fierce little reactor is born.\n\nYour children are yours forever. And we are happy to arrange for their grandchildren to prosper.
Mars '','' "The wind wiped away our footprints. When the storm had passed, we found something shining beneath the sand..."\n\nIn the years since the Collapse, much of Mars has returned to the desolation that came before the\n\nTraveler. But buried beneath its surface are traces of the glimmering megacities that once sprawled across the planet, swallowed by dunes and Darkness.
Meridian Bay '','' "A great city is a place where man competes with the Gods."\n\nUnder the shifting sands of Meridian Bay are the ruins of the magnificent Freehold, a testament to the glory of the Golden Age. Great secrets remain hidden in its crumbling towers.
