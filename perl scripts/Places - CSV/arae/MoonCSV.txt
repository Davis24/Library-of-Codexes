Ghost Fragment: Moon '','' Dreams of Alpha Lupi\n\nThe best voices voices that truly matter never allow themselves be heard. This lesson is worth learning again and again.\n\nForever.\n\nYour voice moves as a whisper, murmuring inside larger winds. Only the trusted few can absorb what is necessary. Wise and sly and perfect, your instructions drop, leaving nothing but the hard sweet rime of enlightenment.\n\nThe path is set. Your voice is unleashed.
Ghost Fragment: The Ocean of Storms '','' BY ORDER OF THE CITY CONSENSUS AND THE GUARDIAN VANGUARD\n\nALL SHIPS IMMEDIATE/REPEAT AND RELAY\n\nWe hereby terminate all organized combat operations on or around Earth's Moon.\n\nEffective immediately we declare the existence of an interdiction on the Moon and cisLunar space.\n\nGuardians operating in this interdict will receive no formal support from the Vanguard or from assets of the City. We urge Guardians to exhibit the greatest care and consideration in approaching the interdicted space.\n\nWe furthermore derogate all strategic objectives concerned with the recovery of assets or information from the Lunar surface, and, without exemption, cancel in whole and in all its parts the effort to establish a beachhead and strategic presence upon the Moon.\n\nThis interdict will remain in effect until such time as the hostile presence on the Moon poses a demonstrable existential threat, or until intelligence is obtained that leads to the defeat of the enemy leadership elements recently encountered.\n\nGuardians with an accurate assessment of losses in the recent days, or with intelligence on the nature and method of hostile resistance, should report to the Vanguard immediately for debriefing.
Moon '','' "We once looked to the Moon and saw hope. Now we see only the power of the Darkness."\n\nEarth's Moon was where we first faced the terror of the Hive, and it soon became the battlefield of a great war one we did not win. In the years since, the Hive have ripped the Moon's surface apart, opening chasms that swarm with terrors.
The Ocean of Storms '','' 唯恐瓊樓玉宇，
高處不勝寒。
起舞弄清影，
何似在人間。 - Poem Excerpt, 蘇軾, Chinese poet, Song Dynasty, Old Earth\n\nThe support base centered here marks what most believe was the first off-Earth colony.\n\nIt was here that we came facetoface with Crota and his legions, a force so powerful we abandoned the Moon. Now, Hive temples breach the surface, entrances into the vast necropolis below, and\n\nGuardians venture into the depths to seek revenge most never to return.
