Out beyond the Reef its rings shine. Whatever was known of it in the Golden Age is long forgotten,
but more ancient truth remains: Saturn has dozens of moons, including the mighty Titan, a world
larger than Mercury.
A Guardian's ship might, in theory, reach Saturn, especially if supported by a larger vessel and good
navigational data. But the hazards of the Reef and the Deep Black beyond threaten to devour anyone
who makes the attempt.

Dreams of Alpha Lupi
A cold giant shows its night face to you. Distant moons slide past icy
little comets enslaved by a
splendid master.
The lightning bolts and high clouds sweep away, and you burrow into a sea of liquid hydrogen that
boils out of the long gash.
You put yourself on the perfect trajectory, and for a fraction of an instant you allow yourself the luxury
of confidence.
