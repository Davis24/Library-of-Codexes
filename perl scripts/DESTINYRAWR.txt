Card: Guardians , Points: 0
"Legends are carved across history by the brave."
Guardians are warriors forged in the Traveler's Light, a final hope in a universe falling into Darkness.
Chosen from the dead by the Traveler's Ghosts, Guardians are those rare few able to wield the Light
as a weapon. For centuries they have defended the City. But that defense cannot hold forever.
Now, with the Darkness rising again, the time has come to retake our lost worlds. The Guardians who
lead the way will save humanity and
become legend.
Card: Titan , Points: 0
"Strive for honor. Stand for hope."
Titans are warriors heroic
defenders of the Light, channeling the gifts of the Traveler to wage war on
the Darkness. Steadfast and sure, Titans face any challenge headon,
blunt force instruments of the
Traveler's will.

/ Tighten that strap.
/ Eh?
/ The gardbrace is loose. Could slip.
/ Huh.
/ It's new?
/ Agema. Type 1.
/ How's it hold up? I tried using Agema at the Gap, remember? It didn't well,
what's this?
/ A Ghost!
/ Yes. Light be with you.
/ Excuse me, little Ghost Tubach,
pass me my helmet thank
you. Little Ghost, what are you doing
here?
/ It's just looking around.
/ Where's your Guardian?
/ I don't think it has one.
/ Well, any servant of the Light is welcome among us. We are Holborn's Host, and I'm Holborn. The
City's hand on Mars.
/ Tubach.
/ That's Tubach, my second. One of the finest Titans of the City. Now see here, little Ghost, on my
shoulder? That's the mark of Holborn's Host. Record it. The twelvepointed
star. One for each of the oh
well, off it goes! It doesn't look well.
/ We should get moving.
/ A Ghost without a Guardian. I remember when I was risen, you know. When I woke in that
wreckage, to see my Ghost hovering there, its light in my eyes, like an angel. And it said /
This story again.
/ Disrespectful youngster.
/ Youngster? I could be older than you, Tibon!
/ True. The gardbrace is fine now. Stop worrying at it. Will you take the Jigoku?
/ Thought I'd take the long rifle. Bayle has the Jigoku.
/ Good. That Ghost what
do you think is wrong with it? It's echoing something ancient, an Old Earth
language. You know what that Ghost reminds me of, flitting about over there?
/ I don't.
/ The time Ghosts from Jagi's Host came back without them. Remember they
got in that fight at
some point east of the Caspian? Seven Ghosts, damn near silent, buzzing with some sort of
corruption. Drifting back to the Tower, one by one. Scared the Speaker well enough.
/ I remember. A long time ago. Jagi tells the story differently.
/ Well. We all grow old. In our way. Little Ghost! Come back here!
/ It's not going to make it, wherever it's going.
/ I want to talk to it. Little Ghost!
/ Lyssa and Bayle are probably there already.
/ Cabal move slowly. We've got time.
/ But the Warlocks have had a vision.
/ Yes. That new one, what's her name. Ingora?
/ Ikora.
/ She's always been hasty. I've faced these Cabal before. I know 'em like I know my own armor.
/ Message from Lyssa. "At the Dust Palace, now. All quiet."
/ See? All quiet. Why not come with us, little Ghost? We are looking for the old Warmind here, and the
one who guards it.
Card: Hunter , Points: 0
"Our old worlds have grown feral rabid
beasts with teeth of rust and ruin. But such beasts
are meant to be tamed. Or broken."
Hunters stalk the wilderness beyond the City, harnessing the Light to reclaim the secrets of our lost
worlds. They are daring scouts and stealthy killers, expert with knives and precision weapons.
Hunters blaze their own trails and write their own laws.
Card: Ghost Fragment: Hunter , Points: 5
She leaves the Sparrow and climbs a long way across spars of volcano rock and between vents of
blue fire. Down below the Ishtar ruins spark with skirmish light but the guns seem as distant and brief
as the constant starfall and the brooding crater high above. She is alone on the rock. She goes on
with her head down so as to fight the sense that she is going to fall up off the world and burn like an
inverse meteor.
The message that brought her to this place had no sign but she could hear Cayde in it. Draksis in the
Cinders it said. Is it true?
And also: Remember your promise.
At dawn she finds a sentry and kills it with her knife. Its throat bleeds gas. She takes its post and lays
out her bullets one by one on the rock as if to make a count of all the years she has been waiting. Her
rifle is near as long as she is tall. She lies down by her bullets and uses them to kill the other sentries
one by one until at last they understand the thunder and the Shanks rise up angry from the Cinders
below to seek her out.
She leaves the rifle and walks across the naked obsidian into the swarm firing from the hip as she
goes, each kick of the old revolver a word, Draksis, Draksis, Kell of Winter, Kell of hate, lord of the
kingdom of her vendetta. Her jaw aches. She used to imagine biting out his throat with armored teeth.
The stone smokes around her where the arc fire lashes it and the shrapnel guns throw up leaves of
obsidian like glass butterflies. She shoots her bandoliers dry and a team of Vandals in glassy stealth
leap up to rush her with knives but she raises her hand and burns them down with the golden gun,
laughing, crying out Draksis, Draksis, I am come!
She kills them all and takes the next ridge, high above the Cinders. She can see the bluegreen
pools
and the cave mouths where the Vex lights dance. And there among them, gowned in smoke and ash,
is the long shark shape of a Ketch, a Wintership, the Kell's ship, come down to nest.
She could go down there now and finish this. But she made a promise.
A Captain jumps her. She throws two knives into his armor and then staves his chest in with her own
Ghost, wrapped up in her fist like a stone.
"Tell the Vanguard," she says to her Etherspattered
fist. "Tell them Draksis is here."
Her Ghost looks up at her in silence. When she makes no move to go down the cliff towards the ship
it blinks once, in its own way, and makes a soft sound, like a sigh, like relief.

"We have found new ways to weaponize curiosity. Pathways into the darkness."
Warriorscholars
of the Light, Warlocks devote themselves to understanding the Traveler and its
power. A Warlock's mind is an arsenal of deadly secrets, balanced between godhood and madness.
On the battlefield, those secrets can shatter reality itself.
Card: Ghost Fragment: Warlock , Points: 5
Why did I set her on the trail?
You try and try and try to explain, but no one ever understands. No one who's not a Warlock. Who
hasn't spent a dozen years scouring the ruins for one string of symbols, one clean code, one black
talon. Titans just make a hmphing noise, if they've stayed awake. Hunters clean their nails with their
knives and look at you like you've grown a third eye.
But when you've spent your life searching through arcana for ancient power, you have the urge to
reach out and educate others. Especially if you've had one too many.
Nah, she's not my type at all. We've played dice, cards, war games, you know, the usual stuff. I'd
never tried to show off before. I don't know what came over me.
I had a broken vertebrae in my pocket that I'd borrowed from yes,
borrowed, I was going to put it
back what
do you think you are, my conscience? It was a fossil, that means mineral replacement, a
rock, basically. They can survive a few hours in my pocket. Do shut up.
The Cryptarchs weren't going to miss it. Everyone knows the Ahamkaras were hunted to extinction.
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.
Think of how mysterious this system is, I said. How much life sprang up when the Traveler came. Like
the Ahamkara. Do you know the legends? The dragon that made promises? And I pulled out the fossil
with a flourish She
pulled out her knife and started to pick the dirt from her nails. That set me off.
You could never have brought down one of these, I said. Ever. Not the greatest Hunter, not the
brawniest Titan.
Her eyes narrowed. She said, Oh? Is that so? And I saw right then that she wasn't going to pass on
the challenge.
I've murdered a Guardian, I thought. She's going to die. It'll be my fault.
And I looked at the piece of spine in my hand and wondered why
did I say that? What moved me to
such pride?
Card: Ghost Fragment: Warlock 2 , Points: 5
My name is Eriana3,
disciple of the Praxic Warlocks, marked by the Cormorant Seal. We came here
under one banner, united in a host of thousands, to claim the Moon. But the battle goes against us. I
have taken a prisoner and this is the record of its interrogation. If I transgress in your eyes I ask for
your forgiveness.
[sound of current or discharge]
/Eriana. It responds to pain.
It responds to the Light. Hurt it again. Monster, heed me. Who is your master with the sword?
[static event]
I can hear it. In my head. The swordbearer's name is CROTA. Record that.
/Should I burn it again?
No. I think you're only feeding it. I will touch its mind. Ghost help.
They call you Wizard. You must be ancient. I think you value power very much. Will you still be
powerful without this piece of your mind?
Tell me how to kill Crota.
[static event]
It showed me the battle. It showed me Wei Ning dead on Crota's blade. It showed me how Crota
killed a Guardian with a screaming knife hammered out of his own Ghost.
So I will take a piece of its mind, and ask again.
Tell me how to kill Crota.
[static event]
Incredible. Where? Where is his throne? Where is the twilight world under the dead star eye?
/Eriana there's word from the company in Mare Imbrium. Crota is upon them. Half a hundred dead.
They need us.
Tell me where! Tell me how! TELL ME!
[static event]
/Eriana what did it say It
showed me how it did this, just exactly this, to an Awoken man, the knives arranged by its will, like
little silver ships, like Ghosts It
laughed at me. It said we were the same.
/Crota marches with a thousand Knights and they say the sky above Mare Imbrium has turned into
green fire. They are dying in numbers I cannot bear to repeat. He kills them one by one with a sword
that eats their Light. Eriana, we have to do something Kill
the Wizard. Scatter the ash. It has nothing but lies to offer.
Get your Sparrows. We have Light and fury. That will be enough.

"This was our world, our solar system. We were here first. And no matter what the darkness
brings, we will be here at the dawn."
Humans are survivors, tough and resilient, descended from those who built a Golden Age only to see
it ripped away. Now, after an age of retreat and desperate struggle, they fight to take back their solar
system and claim a new future.
There are those who believe the Traveler chose Earth for a reason. Now it is humanity's obligation to
prove itself worthy of the Traveler's faith.
Card: Ghost Fragment: Human , Points: 5
From the diaries of Commander Jacob Hardy, pilot, Ares One
The mission is a go. Crew of three: Mihaylova, Qiao, myself. Immediate departure at the next
Hohmann window to Mars. The MREs and return ships will chase us out.
How do I feel? I said at the press conference I felt privileged. Historians will read this diary, but it won't
take their insight to tell the world that I'm terrified. It's the human reaction.
What I wish I could convey is the the
exhilaration. That's the biggest thing. I'm not a spiritual man,
but I've always believed there's something transcendent about spaceflight. Something pure. We go
out there because we can. Because it's who we are.
Now we go because we have to. Because the unknown came to us. In fourteen months we'll be face
to face with it, and by the time we arrive, it should be active again just
like it was active on Jupiter,
and Mercury, and Venus.
I wonder what happens if it doesn't stop at Mars. I wonder if it'll leave us there in the sand, and come
to Earth, and do here what it's done everywhere else.
I hate that we're carrying weapons. I understand the necessity. But I hold to my belief: there's
something beautiful out there.
It's up to us to reach it.
Card: Ghost Fragment: Human 2 , Points: 5
From the diaries of Commander Jacob Hardy, pilot, Ares One
Everybody asks about the words.
The truth is I'm not much of a poet. Ares One didn't leave us with bandwidth for anything except blunt
competence. We came in perilously hot, trying to select a landing site through the chaos of thickening
atmosphere and turbulence that bloomed off the target. A twenty minute roundtrip
lightspeed delay to
Earth meant we could only count on ourselves.
When the number three engine went diagnostic during the second course correction, I thought we
might go catastrophic.
But Qiao brought us in. Mihaylova brought us in. I just flew the ship.
The Ares One excursion vehicle was built for thin winds and icy dust. We came down into a storm: the
breath of God, a ripple of change rolling down off the artifact. We aborted on three sites and finally I
took us into powered hover and brought us down on reflexes and instinct.
Then we ran the checklists, suited up, and left the vehicle.
There was a script, and it's true, I botched it. I got my boots down and I made the most famous gaffe
in human history. Said the first thing that came to mind: a warning to the others.
"We're walking into a rising wind."
I didn't mean to say anything immortal. I just thought it'd be useful to know.
Card: Ghost Fragment: Human 3 , Points: 10
From the diaries of Commander Jacob Hardy, pilot, Ares One
The hike from Ares One.
You've watched it. Everything was recorded. I think you can get it in full immersion, now, and fly
around like a hummingbird. I'll add what I can.
The route was planned. We all went together the
CEV and Ares One itself had enough automation
to go home alone in the event of crew loss. Whatever we'd find at the artifact, it needed the human
element.
We carried rifles. They made us heavier and slower and probably less safe. I think the argument
about the rifles can be left for another time. What's important is It
turned out well. Look at me. Look at us! You're talking to a ninetyyearold
man. A ninetyyearold
who's never been sharper. I'm miles ahead of every cognitive benchmark.
What's happened to me is good. What's happened to all of us is good. When we crested that rise and
made visual contact with the artifact I don't think any one of us dared dream that it would end this
well.
We went to Mars at the cutting edge of human civilization. And it wasn't our weapons that won the
day.
It was our ship. Our training. Our camaraderie. Our belief that if we just reached out to the universe,
not to grasp for profit or security but with an open hand, we would be elevated.
We were right. That makes me so happy. To this day.
Card: Ghost Fragment: Human 4 , Points: 15
From the diaries of Commander Jacob Hardy, pilot, Ares One
Three human beings stood on a high ridge and saw the shape of the future. Saw rain strike a
millenniaold
desert. Felt the air sweeten with oxygen and warm water and the beginnings of life.
I am sometimes asked if I felt something die. The end of the era of human selfsufficiency.
I don't know how to answer that question. I do know that I was changed. Nobody could experience
that kind of wonder and remain unchanged. The decades since have proven that to me.
I knew I'd never fly another mission like that. I recognized the need for a new love. That's why I threw
my fresh cognitive skills into understanding the Traveler. How can one entity so quickly and utterly
remake an entire world? Fifty years later, I'm conversant in high mathematics, particularly topological
thoughts and the slippery irreality of Light. I'm involved in a project to study the Traveler's terraforming
actions right now.
But I still enjoy the interviews. I like going back to that mission.
It makes me unspeakably happy to see how well it all turned out. And it makes me happy to
remember I was there.

Card: Awoken , Points: 0
"The others sing this song of Light and Dark. We, together, have transcended such

It is said that the Awoken were born in the Collapse, descended from those who tried to flee its wrath.
Something happened to them out on the edge of the deep black, and they were forever changed.
Today many Awoken live in the distant Reef, aloof and mysterious. But others returned to Earth,
where their descendants now fight for the City.

I was nothingness. If I existed before, I existed as possibility, as potential, stretched thin across the
aether. And maybe there was a body that looked like my body, complete with a soul that could be
confused for someone rather like me. What I am now was not yet real. And then I was born, and the
universe was free to begin.
Others were present at my birth.
A great ceremony had just begun. Because newborns are selfish beasts, I assumed I was the object
of attention.
I didn't notice the singing until the singers fell silent. And then She appeared.
She was above me. Ethereal and handsome and elegant. I assumed my face was like her face and
that odd idea gave me strength enough to smile.
"Secrets," she said. "Creation is built on secrets and the encryptions that keep those secrets safe."
I made my first sound. It meant nothing but she understood it as a question.
"We are a beautiful creation," she said. "And we must keep ourselves very safe."

"Ask yourself: what threatened your Golden Age ancestors so much that they constructed the
Exos to defend themselves?"
Built for a longforgotten
struggle, Exos are selfaware
war machines so advanced that nothing short
of a Ghost can understand their inner functions. They remain ciphers, even to themselves: their
origins and purpose lost to time.
Whoever built the Exos fashioned them in humanity's image, gifting them with diversity of mind and
body. Many of the City's Exo citizens live and work alongside their organic brethren. But others fight
again, reforged
in the Light of the Traveler to serve as Guardians.

which
in the end is just a matter of substrate chauvinism. It doesn't matter if the system thinks with
flesh or superconductor or topological braids in doped metallic hydrogen, as long as the logic is the
same. And our logic is the same. Yours and mine.
If I am a machine then so are you. If you are not a machine then neither am I. Exo minds are human.
It is incontrovertible.
You understand? I'm going to take that slackjawed
stare as understanding.
Now here's the real question. Why are Exo minds human? What's the design imperative? Why does a
war machine yes,
absolutely, I am a war machine, built by human handsÍ¾ and you are a survival
machine built by the engine of evolution. Don't interrupt me.
Why does a war machine have emotions? Why should a war machine have awareness? These are
not useful traits on the battlefield. Don't flatter yourself. They are not useful. So why should the Exo
mind mimic the human architecture so closely?
You know what I smell on you? I smell the stink of anthropocentrism. I think you think that there's only
one way to think. That's why the Exo mind is so human, you presume. Because all higher thought
converges.
My friend, you should meet the Vex. There is nothing human in them.
Now. This is what I believe happened, back in the time before any Exo can remember. It explains
everything.
I think someone wanted to live forever.

"In its dying breath, the Traveler created the Ghosts...To seek out those who can wield its
Light as a weapon. Guardians, to protect us, and do what the Traveler itself no longer can."
Built from machinery and the Traveler's Light, Ghosts guide their Guardian companions in the quest
to reclaim our solar system.
Every Ghost seeks out its Guardian among the ancient dead. The Ghost serves as scout, librarian,
and mechanic, waking ancient machinery and cracking alien codes. In the right situations, a Ghost
can even save a Guardian from death.
But Ghosts are not immortal. As far as Guardians know, every loss is irreplaceable.
Card: Dead Ghosts , Points: 0
Battered and drained of their Light, these Ghosts are nevertheless valuable for the information they
preserve. Their recovered memories may well prove vital to the City's survival.
The problem of dead Ghosts troubles the City's scholars. Are new Ghosts still being born? Or is the
number of Ghosts dwindling? Will there come a day when no more remain an
end to the rise of new
Guardians?
If that day is coming, then the City faces a desperate race against time to heal the Traveler before

Beyond.
It is a place, a place casting shadows and emotion.
It's a real place, I know.
One hot blue sun, say. And other suns too. Five? I like seven better. What I'm recalling is a giant star
with a family of six smaller suns, and you could spend days and nights counting all of the planets
circling those suns...except there are no planets. Not anymore. The powers in charge have carved up
all of the worlds, and maybe a brown dwarf or two for good measure. With that rubble, they fashioned
a topologically creative enclosure, a twisting of space and time sealed behind doors that admit only
those who know the magic words. The bones of a hundred planets have been cut smooth and laid out
like a floor, a polished and lovely floor creating vast living spaces. A floor bigger than ten thousand
worlds, catching the fierce glory of the seven suns. For light, for food. For beauty. And nothing
escapes. Not heat, not gravity. Not even the faintest proud sound.
It could be anywhere. It can live in the cold between galaxies, or folded up inside matter, near enough
to touch right now...
I remember it and maybe it's exactly as I describe it. Seven suns wrapped inside magic. Or it's
something else entirely, perhaps. A place still fat with life. An abundance of sentient souls, some
decent, maybe a few of lesser quality, and everybody stands about or floats about, or they bounce
between dimensions. The point is that the residents of this hidden realm live inside a bottle so
perfectly hidden that they can't see beyond their own borders. Which shapes a mind in very specific
ways.
But, Beyond is their name for a mysterious, doubtful realm that they can't see.
Which is us, of course.

"There is a Light in you from which no Darkness can hide."
Only Guardians have the gift of the Traveler's Light the
ability to channel its energies to project vast
power into the world. Even without a firearm, a Guardian is a radiant engine of destruction.
While these abilities rise from within, Guardians master their power in different ways. Titans
understand the Light as a force to hone through practice and strict discipline. Hunters roam and
explore in order to learn, using dangerous methods to survive the wilds. And Warlocks study the Light
and its inner mechanisms, confronting unfathomable mysteries in the search for transcendent might.

From Lord Saladin's Induction Speech
Nothing born is born strong.
I know I began weak, the same as you. I don't care if you're an Exo, staring at that number and
wondering where you've come from. Or a Human hungry to understand the ancient world that left you
for dead. Or an Awoken reborn in the very essence of what your people hide from. Together, we're
the pointed end of a long stick of happenstance. Change one ripple in an ancient ocean and we would
never have been granted the Light within us, or the good Ghosts that want to help us.
Humble origins.
Every world begins as a big pebble lost among trillions of pebbles. Every worthy sun was once cold
hydrogen spread thin across the vacuum. Even the universe, this cosmic garden that surrounds us
and awes us...this monument to Creation was once the size of an apple seed. And everything that's
splendid and great stands at the end of incalculable chance and mayhem.

"At close quarters a fist is better than any gun."

Collection: Movement Modes
Cards:
Double Jump
Glide
Blink
Lift
Card: Double Jump , Points: 0
Bend momentum to jump again in midair.
Leap to even greater heights, or make a quick adjustment
while airborne to disorient your foes.
Card: Glide , Points: 0
Break the bonds of gravity and convert your jump into a long, smooth glide. Cross dangerous terrain
and float from perch to perch to keep the high ground.
Card: Blink , Points: 0
Rip a hole in space and leap from point to point. Master the Blink, and you will be a fearsome killer a
spectral force, hard to evade and impossible to pin down.
Card: Lift , Points: 0

way to break contact, gain control of the high ground, or set up devastating ambushes.
Collection: Super Abilities
Cards:
Fist of Havoc
Ward of Dawn
Golden Gun
Arc Blade
Nova Bomb
Radiance
Card: Fist of Havoc , Points: 0
Leap forward and smash the ground, obliterating everything nearby. You will be a thunderbolt but
use your fury carefully. If there are survivors, you will surely draw their wrath.
Card: Ward of Dawn , Points: 0
Open a pocket in the universe, an impregnable fortress for you and your allies. The mighty Ward
allows Guardians to hold key points and gather their strength in the face of overwhelming opposition.
Card: Golden Gun , Points: 0
Draw a hand cannon burning with Solar Light and loaded with three rounds of sunfire. Aim steady and
keep your wits about you. You are a Gunslinger, and this is what you live for.
Card: Arc Blade , Points: 0
Set aside your weapons and lose yourself in the blade trance. Arc Light galvanizes your armor and
hastens your movements, and when your knife finds a target it discharges a snap of annihilating
current. For as long as the trance lasts, you are the very shadow of death.
Card: Nova Bomb , Points: 0
Channel the Traveler's Light into a bolt of energy with the power of a collapsing star. The devastating
Nova Bomb scours the battlefield with ethereal fire but
be careful in its use. It takes precious
moments to summon, and it must be aimed precisely to avoid obstacles.
Card: Radiance , Points: 0
Open yourself to the Light. Glimpse, for a few rapturous moments, the truth beyond the powers you
wield.
A Warlock in a state of Radiance threatens to slip beyond the bonds of the material, shrugging off
physical harm, channeling a torrent of abilities. Some may learn to elevate nearby Guardians, gifting
them with power. Others, entranced by the Ghosts' power to reach beyond death, may learn to pluck
themselves out of nothingness like the phoenix of ancient myth.

Card: Auto Rifles , Points: 5
Allpurpose
weapons of war, the standard Auto Rifle is ideal for a number of combat scenarios.
Stability is key to controlling fully automatic weapons.
Card: SUROS Regime , Points: 0
Nostalgia as a weapon of war. Style as a hallmark of victory.
Suros engineers designed the Regime using recovered Golden Age schematics. Forced out of
production by a crippling shortage of smartmatter, the few remaining models are cherished by those
Guardians fortunate enough to wield them.
Card: Hard Light , Points: 0
Ionized polymer synballistic attack platform. The system's lethality is dynamically robust
across tactical spaces.
As the City's understanding of Golden Age methods expands, foundries continue to push the cutting
edge of tactical armament. The Hard Light prototype is a showcase, built with the rarest recovered
materials and the most computationally demanding design methods. The design team included
several specialist Exos and at least one Warlock thanatonaut.
In its current iteration, the Hard Light design fires a superheated polymer round with exotic
capabilities.
Card: Monte Carlo , Points: 0
There will always be paths to tread and methods to try. Roll with it.
Originally designed as a showpiece, the Monte Carlo's sleek demeanor and intricate firing system
make it more than a fashion statement. In the right hands, this beauty puts all the risk at the wrong
end of its bayonet.
Card: Scout Rifles , Points: 5
The preferred weapon of seasoned marksmen, the Scout Rifle is a singleshot
precision firearm.
Favoring accuracy above all else, the Scout Rifle packs increased stopping power to counter its low
rate of fire.
Card: MIDA MultiTool
, Points: 0
Select application: Ballistic engagement. Entrenching tool. Avionics trawl. Troll smasher.
Stellar sextant. List continues.
Few weapons are balanced this precisely. Once you get a feel for the MultiTool
it will sit weightlessly
in your hand. Firing it will feel less like an action and more like an extension of your will.
Card: The Fate of all Fools , Points: 0
The wise man knows his fate. The fool merely finds it.
The weapon gathers data on the target from the impact and spall of solid body shots, setting up a
devastating final hit.
Card: Pulse Rifles , Points: 5
The Pulse Rifle is designed for precision fire and tight shot grouping. Threeround
bursts provide
added punch with reduced recoil compared to fully automatic weapons. Skilled shooters often walk
the burst from the target's center of mass onto the head.
Card: Bad Juju , Points: 0
"If you believe your weapon wants to murder all existence, then so it will."
There must be a structured, mechanical explanation for this weapon's hunger for combat. There must
be. But none has been found.
Card: Red Death , Points: 0
Vanguard policy urges Guardians to destroy this weapon on sight. It is a Guardian killer.
Only rumors tell of the mad Guardian who fashioned this butcher's tool. But its power is undeniable,
and fear is a formidable weapon.
Card: Hand Cannons , Points: 5
Sturdy and reliable, Hand Cannons have long been a preferred tool for selfdefense.
Their low rate of
fire and modest accuracy is more than made up for by their ease of handling and superior stopping
power.
Card: Hawkmoon , Points: 0
Stalk thy prey and let loose thy talons upon the Darkness.
The Hawkmoon is a true gunslinger's weapon a
smooth sidearm that makes every bullet
count...some more than others.
Card: The Last Word , Points: 0
"Yours...not mine."
The Last Word is a romantic weapon, a throwback to simpler times when steady aim and large
rounds were enough to dispense justice in the wilds of a lawless frontier. Of course, some might say
that time has come again.
Card: Ghost Fragment: The Last Word , Points: 5
I'm writing this from memory some
mine, but not all. The facts won't sync with the reality, but they'll
be close, and there's no one to say otherwise, so for all intents and purposes, this will be the history
of a settlement we called Palamon and the horrors that followed an all too brief peace.
I remember home, and stories of a paradise we'd all get to see some day of
a City, "shining even in
the night." Palamon didn't shine, but it was sanctuary, of a sort.
We'd settled in the heart of a range that stretched the horizon. Wooded mountains that shot with
purpose toward the sky. Winters were harsh, but the trees and peaks hid us from the world. We
talked about moving on, sometimes, striking out for the City. But it was just a longing.
Drifters came and went. On occasion they would stay, but rarely.
We had no real government, but there was rule of law. Basic tenets agreed upon by all and eventually
overseen by Magistrate Loken.
And there you have it...no government, until there was. I was young, so I barely understood. I
remember Loken as a hardworking man who just became broken. Mostly I think he was sad. Sad and
frightened. As his fingers tightened on Palamon, people left. Those who stayed saw our days became
grey. Loken's protection from
the Fallen, from ourselves became
dictatorial.
Looking back, I think maybe Loken had just lost too much of
himself, his family. But everyone lost
something. And some of us had nothing to begin with. My only memory of my parents is a haze, like a
daydream, and a small light, like the spark of their souls. It's not anything I dwell on. They left me
early, taken by Dregs.
Palamon raised me from there. The family I call my own called
my own cared
for me as if I was
their natural born son. And life was good. Being the only life I knew, my judgment is skewed, and it
wasn't easy pocked
by loss as it was but
I would call it good.
Until, of course, it wasn't.
Until two men entered my world. One a light. The other the darkest shadow I would ever know.
Card: Ghost Fragment: The Last Word 2 , Points: 5
The man I would come to know as Jaren Ward, my third father and quite possibly my closest friend,
came to Palamon from the south.
I was just a boy, but I'll never forget his silhouette on the empty trail as he made his slow walk into
town.
I'd never seen anything like him. Maybe none of us had. He'd said he was only passing through, and I
believed him still
do, but life can get in the way of intent, and often does.
I can picture that day with near perfect clarity. Of all the details though every
nuance, every moment
the
memory that sticks in my mind is the iron on Jaren's hip. A cannon that looked both pristine and
lived in. Like a relic of every battle he'd ever fought, hung low at his waste a
trophy and a warning.
This man was dangerous, but there was a light about him a
pureness to his weight that
seemed to
hint that his ire was something earned, not carelessly given.
I'd been the first to see him as he approached, but soon most of Palamon had turned out to greet him.
My father held me back as everyone stood in silence.
Jaren didn't make a sound behind his sleek racer's helmet. He looked just like the heroes in the
stories, and to this day I'm not sure one way or the other if the silence between the town's people and
the adventurer was born of fear or respect. I like to think the latter, but any truth I try to place on the
moment would be of my own making.
As we waited for Magistrate Loken to arrive and make an official greeting, my patience got the best of
me. I shook free of my father's heavy hand and made the short sprint across the court, stopping a few
paces from where this new curiosity stood a
man unlike any other.
I stared up at him and he lowered his attention to me, his eyes hidden behind the thick tinted visor of
his headgear. My sight quickly fell to his sidearm. I was transfixed by it. I imagined all the places that
weapon had been. All of the wonders it had seen. The horrors it had endured. My imagination darted
from one heroic act to the next.
I barely registered when he began to kneel, holding out the iron as if an offering. But my eyes locked
onto the piece, mesmerized.
I recall turning back to my father and seeing the looks on the faces of everyone I knew. There was
worry there my
father slowly shaking his head as if pleading with me to ignore the gift.
I turned back to the man I would come to know as Jaren Ward, the finest Hunter this system may ever
know and one of the greatest Guardians to ever defend the Traveler's Light...
And I took the weapon in my hand. Carefully. Gently.
Not to use. But to observe. To imagine. To feel its weight and know its truth.
That was the first time I held "Last Word," but, unfortunately, not the last.
Card: Thorn , Points: 0
"To rend one's enemies is to see them not as equals, but objects hollow
of spirit and
meaning."
Augmented through dark practices, Thorn was once a hero's weapon. Its jagged frame hints at a
sinister truth: a powerful connection to the unutterable sorceries of the Hive.
The legend of Thorn is bound to the rise and fall of Dredgen Yor, a Guardian whose name is
remembered with disgust and shame. The weapon was thought destroyed...but rumors of its
existence still haunt the wilds.
Card: Ghost Fragment: Thorn , Points: 5
The Rose
The noble man stood. And the people looked to him. For he was a beacon hope
given form, yet still
only a man. And within that truth there was great promise. If one man could stand against the night,
then so too could anyone everyone.
In his strong hand the man held a Rose. And his aura burned bright.
When the man journeyed on, the people remembered. In his wake hope spread. But the man had a
secret fear. His thoughts were dark. A sadness crept from the depths of his being. He had been a
hero for so long, but pride had led him down sorrow's road.
Slowly the shadows' whisper became a voice, a dark call, offering glories enough to make even the
brightest Light wander. He knew he was fading, yet he still yearned.
On his last day he sat and watched the sun fall. His final thoughts, pure of mind, if not body, held to a
fleeting hope though
they would suffer for the man he would become, the people would remember
him as he had been.
And so the noble man hid himself beneath a darkness no flesh should touch, and gave up his mortal
self to claim a new birthright. Whether this was choice, or destiny, is a truth known only to fate.
In that cool evening air, as dusk was devoured by night, the noble man ceased to exist. In his place
another stood.
Same meat. Same bone. But so very different.
The first and only of his family. The sole forbearer and last descendent of the name Yor.
In his first moments as a new being, he looked down at his Rose and realized for the first time that it
held no petals: only the jagged purpose of angry thorns.

[u.2:0.3] No, you haven't.
[u.1:0.5] Looks dangerous.
[u.2:0.4] Seems, maybe, that's the point.
[u.1:0.6] Suppose so.
[u.1:0.7] Can I see it?
[u.2:0.5] Not likely.

[u.1:0.8] Where'd...where'd you find it?

[u.1:0.9] You hearin' me?

[u.3:0.1] He asked you question.

[u.2:0.6] Didn't find it. Made it.
[u.1:1.0] Heh. Helluva touch you got then. You a 'smith?
[u.2:0.7] I look like a 'smith?
[u.1:1.1] Looks can be deceiving.
[u.2:0.8] Got that right.
[u.1:1.2] There a problem?
[u.2:0.9] Doesn't need to be.
[u.1:1.3] Glad we got that cleared up...Now, about that piece.
[silence]
[u.2:1.0] Been to Luna?
[u.1:1.4] Excuse me?
[u.2:1.1] The Moon. You been?
[u.1:1.5] Nobody's been.
[u.2:1.2] That a truth?
[u.1:1.6] That's a fact.
[u.2:1.3] Funny you'd make that distinction.
[u.1:1.7] Truth is you must think you're some kinda something special. With that attitude. The way
you're just dismissin' us like you we're nothing...like we ain't even here.
[u.1:1.8] Fact is...You ain't near as rock solid as you figure. Fact is, special's only special 'til it's not.
[silence]
[u.2:1.4] The bones say otherwise.
[u.1:1.9] Speak straight.
[u.2:1.5] You say "nobody." Bones say otherwise.
[u.1:2.0] What bones?
[u.2:1.6] All of them.
[u.1:2.1] What're you gettin' at?
[u.2:1.7] Too many to count.
[u.1:2.2] You trying to get a rile outta us? Was only making conversation.
[u.2:1.8] You really weren't.
[u.4:0.1] We got a smart one here.
[u.2:1.9] Experienced more than smart. But experience has its advantages.
[u.1:2.3] Experience tell you to lip off to strangers just tryin' to make talk?
[u.2:2.0] Keep insisting and maybe we will.
[u.1:2.4] Talk?
[u.2:2.1] Have words.
[u.1:2.5] Ain't that what we're doin'?
[u.2:2.2] My conversations tend to be a bit louder.
[silence]
[u.1:2.6] That a threat.
[u.2:2.3] A truth.
[u.1:2.7] Who the hell you think you are?
[u.2:2.4] According to your facts, "nobody." Yet, here I sit.
[u.1:2.8] Don't matter much how pretty yer cannon is. You keep it up, we'll see just how loud you like
to get.
[silence]
[u.1:2.9] You done talkin' now? Guess he knows his place, boys.
[u.2:2.5] Ever have a nightmare?
[u.1:3.0] You playin' games? Or just thick?
[u.2:2.6] I know you have. This world? Can't help, but.
[u.1:3.1] I don't have nightmares. I give 'em.
[u.2:2.7] You are a goddamn cliché. The picture perfect bandit.
[u.2:2.8] Hearing your voice the
things you're saying, the shade of the hard man you pretend to be...
[u.1:3.2] Ain't no shade.
[audible crack]

[u.2:3.0] Sit. Down.
[u.2:3.1] Your mouth just got your friends dead.
[u.2:3.2] This is what happens when you bore me. And right now...
[u.2:3.3] I'm so very bored.
[u.1:3.3] Wha...No listen...
[u.2:3.4] Shhhhh.
[u.1:3.4] But...but...you're a...you're one of them...A Guardian, right?
[u.1:3.5] You're supposed t'be one'a the good ones.
[u.2:3.5] "Supposed to be?" Maybe I am. Maybe this is what "good" looks like.
[u.2:3.6] Anymore, who can tell?
[u.1:3.6] I...
[u.2:3.7] You wanted to see my prize.
[u.1:3.7] No...I...
[u.2:3.8] Look at it.
[u.1:3.8] I...

[audible sobbing]
[u.2:4.1] Look at it.
[u.2:4.2] Open your eyes.
[audible sobbing]
[u.2:4.3] Not many get such a clean view.
[u.2:4.4] The bone...You see it. Jagged, like thorns.
[u.2:4.5] I used to think of it as a rose...
[u.2:4.6] Focusing on its bloom.
[u.2:4.7] But the bloom is just a byproduct of its anger.
[silence]
[u.2:4.8] You have nightmares?
[audible sobbing]
[u.2:4.9] Ever seen a nightmare? Ever opened your eyes and realized the horror wasn't a dream? The
terror wasn't gone?
[u.2:5.0] I've seen nightmares.
[u.2:5.1] They live in the shadows.
[u.2:5.2] They've been watching.
[u.2:5.3] I thought...It's foolish, I know...but I thought I saw a way.
[u.2:5.4] That maybe we could win. Maybe we could survive.
[u.2:5.5] But once you step into those shadows, it's so very hard to walk in the Light.
[u.2:5.6] Or...maybe I just wasn't strong enough.
[u.2:5.7] Maybe.
[u.2:5.8] But I feel strong now.
[audible sobbing]
[u.2:5.9] I stole the dark.
[u.2:6.0] Or, maybe it stole me.
[u.2:6.1] Either way, here we are.
[u.2:6.2] And I'm hungry.
[u.2:6.3] Its hungry.
[u.2:6.4] You have no Light beyond the spark of your pathetic life.
[u.2:6.5] But a spark is something.

Cards:

Invective
Fusion Rifles
Pocket Infinity
Plan C
Vex Mythoclast
Sniper Rifles
Patience and Time
Ice Breaker
Card: Shotguns , Points: 5
There are few weapons that offer the comfort and familiarity of a shotgun. Built for close quarters
combat, they provide immediate, violent conflict resolution.
Card: Universal Remote , Points: 0
To the untrained eye this beast is a junker. To the trained eye, however, this junker...is a beast.
It took great care, and an incredible feat of finetuning,
to craft a weapon that packs a closequarters
punch, yet has the range of a precision rifle. Universal Remote is that weapon.
Card: Invective , Points: 0
"I tried to talk them down. They made a grab for my Ghost. After that it was a short
conversation."
Invective was Ikora Rey's weapon of choice during her younger, more rebellious days. An ideal
fallback for situations that can't be solved by wit, quick talk, or pure intimidation, this modified shotgun
uses a selfreplicating
magazine to keep its owner wellstocked
for any and all trouble that waits
beyond the City.
Card: Fusion Rifles , Points: 5
Advancements in directed energy disbursement, gained through the discovery of Golden Age
research, led to the creation of stable, fieldready
energybased
weaponry. The first implementation of
this technology comes in the form of the Fusion Rifle. Users must hold the trigger down for a few
moments to charge the weapon before firing.
Card: Pocket Infinity , Points: 0
You cannot shake the feeling that this is less a weapon than a doorway.
Fireteam Tuyet died in the Ishtar Sink, hunting the secrets of the Vex. They must have come too
close to something precious, for the Vex descended on them with their typical inscrutable, thorough
violence.
But their sacrifice was not in vain. The data they gathered helped forge the Pocket Infinity. Properly
modified, the weapon should be capable of devastating output on just a single charge cycle.
The Infinity's mechanisms have proven difficult, if not impossible, to replicate en masse. It is
conceivable that the weapon draws its energy from the Vex networks...an ominous possibility. So be
wary with it.
Card: Plan C , Points: 0
Good fighters have contingency plans. Great fighters don't need them.
Sharp reflexes keep you alive on the frontier but
no matter how fast you are, a fusion rifle can only
charge so quickly. Enter the Plan C. When you draw the weapon, fastrise
capacitors and a smart
induction system prime for firing. The 'ready fire' state only lasts a few moments but
in a gunfight,
those moments matter.
Card: Vex Mythoclast , Points: 0
...a causal loop within the weapon's mechanism, suggesting that the firing process somehow
binds space and time into...
Some legends live forever. Others are overwritten reshaped
by the sheer will of those who believe
that any ordeal can be conquered, any foe vanquished, any god cast down.
The Mythoclast is a Vex instrument from some farflung
corner of time and space, mysteriously fit for
human hands. Its origins, mechanism of action, and ultimate purpose remain unknown. Perhaps it will
reveal itself to you, in time...
Card: Sniper Rifles , Points: 5
The dangers present beyond the City's walls cannot always be met headon.
The accuracy and power
of the Sniper Rifle offers the best option for precise ranged attacks. Caliber and make differ, but a
good sniper can always remove key threats.
Card: Patience and Time , Points: 0
If you've got it, they'll never see it coming.
Patience and Time is an assassin's dream. Enhanced sensor integration allows for target tracking
while aiming down the sight, and those who work with the weapon and explore its deeper capabilities
will find lightbending
camouflage systems ready to interface with a Guardian's armor micromaterials.
Card: Ice Breaker , Points: 0
Please replace these components if use causes fatal damage: HEAT SINK. MAGAZINE.
OPERATOR
The Ice Breaker series was a clandestine project developed by the Vanguard in conjunction with
various City weapons foundries. Meant as an exploration of Golden Age weapon technology, the
project was scrapped after only a single weapon reached the testing phase.
The prototypes for the project's lone weapon are considered dangerous and unfit for field duty by the
Vanguard. This hasn't stopped daring Guardians from seeking out the Ice Breakers death,
after all,
is an occupational hazard.
Collection: Heavy Weapons
Cards:
Rocket Launchers
Gjallarhorn
Truth
Machine Guns
Thunderlord
Super Good Advice
Card: Rocket Launchers , Points: 5
Rocket Launchers have a limited, devastating payload that provides an excellent countermeasure to
heavilyarmored
ground forces and combat vehicles. There is no better battlefield equalizer. Skilled
users often aim for the ground beneath nimble targets.
Card: Gjallarhorn , Points: 0
"If there is beauty in destruction, why not also in its delivery?"
The Gjallarhorn shouldermounted
rocket system was forged from the armor of Guardians who fell at
the Twilight Gap. Gifted to the survivors of that terrible battle, the Gjallarhorn is seen as a symbol of
honor and survival.
Card: Truth , Points: 0
"...is where you seek it."
Truth is a cuttingedge
rocket launcher developed by Crux/Lomar. Smart warheads calculate and
understand the user's intent upon firing.
There may have been a time when warfare in the solar system was dominated by lightningquick
AI
weapons and swarms of autonomous munitions. If so, that time is past. The Traveler's Light has given
rise to an age of heroes with undreamt power. But there is still a place for cleverly designed machines
and
as the City's foundries reclaim the technical prowess of the Golden Age, our machines will
become cleverer still.
Card: Machine Guns , Points: 5
The Machine Gun is an unapologetic weapon of war. Its ability to carry and process large quantities of
highcaliber
ammunition allows for sustained, focused attacks, making them ideal for the suppression
and/or annihilation of hostile forces.
Card: Thunderlord , Points: 0
"They rest quiet on fields afar...for this is no ending, but the eye."
Customized with an experimental induction core, the Thunderlord is a heavy machine gun built for the
delivery of sustained punishment.
The weapon's history and mechanism are both shrouded in ritualistic awe. Each round fired is another
word in the legend and
the Guardians who bear the Thunderlord will be immortalized in song.
Card: Super Good Advice , Points: 0
This weapon is full of it.
This machine gun's incredible mechanism hints at the wonders of Golden Age technology. Smart
rounds report their trajectories to the weapon, and a microtransmat
protocol recalls missed shots
directly to the magazine.
Engineers decry the idea that all smart systems spontaneously develop personalities and
awareness...but it seems undeniable that Super Good Advice manifests personality, memory, and a
certain sass. The truth may lie in the weapon's connection to the legendary Hunter Pahanin, who
witnessed the fall of Kabr and became terrified of traveling alone.

Card: Guardian Ships , Points: 5
"It is not enough to defend the City. We must reclaim the stars."
A rare and precious commodity, the jumpships utilized by Guardians are cobbled together from the
salvaged wreckage of interplanetary ships built long ago. Only in recent years have the Tower's
shipwrights begun working to build new hulls from the keel up. The City's factions are also keen to
develop flight capability, whether through salvage or their own shipbuilding projects.
Today, it falls upon each individual Guardian to find and maintain their own craft. Those skilled
enough to acquire a ship with offworld
capabilities join the front line in the long war to retake what is
ours.
Card: Sparrow , Points: 10
"The shortest distance between two points is full throttle."
The Sparrow is a singlepassenger,

Quick, quiet, and simple to transmat, Sparrows enjoy surpassing popularity among Guardians
working in the field.

Card: Glimmer , Points: 0
The programmable matter called 'Glimmer' serves as one of the City's basic currencies. With the right
inputs and an energy source, Glimmer can be transmuted into nearly anything. This makes it precious
to the City's industries and artisans. That value, in turn, makes Glimmer a useful means of exchange especially
with those who venture beyond the City's walls.
Glimmer passes through an economic life cycle. New Glimmer comes from reclaimed Golden Age
caches and technology whether
a tiny mechanism or an underground lode seeded by ancient
machines. This expansion of the Glimmer supply drives down the value of Glimmer. But Glimmer is
also constantly used by the City's industry, which converts it into necessary components and
materials. This sink helps keep Glimmer scarce, and therefore valuable.
Between this inflow and outflow lies the pool of liquidity Glimmer
used as trade currency. Master
Rahool in the Tower, for example, sells recovered matter engrams in exchange for Glimmer, since he
knows he can use Glimmer to acquire new engrams and keep them flowing to Guardians.
Newborn Guardians often complain that they should be issued highquality
gear for free are
they
not, after all, fighting for the future of the City? Unfortunately, this gear requires resources to
manufacture. Guardians must bring in enough Glimmer and other staples, like spinmetal and relic
iron, to keep the engine of the City's economy turning. If good times lead to a resource boom, that
surplus may help massproduce
advanced gear.
Card: Vanguard Marks , Points: 10
When a terrible threat rises, Guardians look to the Vanguard, the closest thing they have to a
command structure. These elite veterans coordinate the reports of roaming Hunters, the analyses of
cloistered Warlocks, and the instincts of grizzled Titans into a single plan of action. And when
Guardians fight as part of that plan, the Vanguard rewards them.
Vanguard Marks are tokens of favor that earn a trusted Guardian access to the Tower's armories.
Listen carefully to the rumblings of Lord Shaxx, and you might come to believe that this system was
meant to keep vital warfighting supplies from being wasted in the Crucible. Talk to Commander
Zavala, and he will reassure you that the Vanguard Mark system exists for one reason: to get the best
equipment into the hands of those who get the best results.
Guardians eager to win Vanguard Marks would do well to participate in Strike missions organized by
the Vanguard.
Card: Crucible Marks , Points: 10
The Crucible is a program of relentless livefire
training, hardening Guardians for battles to come.
Competition thrives on risk and reward, so Lord Shaxx has seen fit to dispense Crucible Marks to
those who excel.
Guardians with a name in the Crucible can spend these Marks on elite gear. Shaxx considers it fitting
that the best should earn the best. The City's factions, fond of using the Crucible as an arena to
advance their own interests, will also accept Crucible marks in exchange for their equipment.
Guardians eager to win Crucible Marks should fight in the Crucible, with particular attention to those
challenges Lord Shaxx deems important.
Card: Motes of Light , Points: 15
The Speaker has no interest in Glimmer, Marks, or the other currencies of the Tower's military
functions. But he happily accepts these Motes, points of Light willed into being by an exercise of a
mighty Guardian's power.
Some say they will one day become the souls of new Ghosts. Others believe they feed the intricate
machinery that the Speaker tends. Whatever the case, the Speaker will happily reward donors with
patterns and signs from his collection more
out of gratitude than any mercantile impulse.
Card: Strange Coins , Points: 15
Each coin rings with a faint, sharp hush as
if it has touched the sounds around it with the edge of
silence.
These could buy incredible things, in the right hands. Whispers say the faceless creature who
sometimes comes to the Tower covets them above all else.
Card: Upgrade Materials , Points: 0
As Guardians buy or salvage new equipment, they learn to tinker and improve. This work requires
Glimmer and other material.
Some can be recycled from unneeded gear. Titans favor plasteel, which can be found by
disassembling old equipment. Hunters unspool discarded armor into sapphire wire. Warlocks extract
hadronic essence from dismantled fieldweave robes. And any Guardian with a sense for weaponry
can disassemble old ordnance into weapon parts.
Other materials need to be scavenged on site, generally in the course of Patrols. The Cosmodrome in
Old Russia is rich with spinmetal, a fantastically light and strong composite created by rogue colonies
of Golden Age machinery that escaped storage. Solar coil systems on the Moon still generate helium
filaments. The baffling, possibly Vexinfluenced
flora of Venus grow spirit blooms. And the surface of
Mars offers deposits of ultradense
relic iron.
The most powerful Guardian equipment transcends ordinary science, entering the realm of Golden
Age secrets and the Traveler's power itself. This wargear demands Ascendant Energy and Ascendant
Shards burning
fragments of the universal fundament, earned through mighty acts of heroism.
Look for them in daily Story challenges and Raids.

Everything changed with the coming of the Traveler.
It gave us gifts that transformed the solar system and the nature of human life. It ushered in the
Golden Age, a time of miracles. But it never shared its deepest secrets.
Where did the Traveler come from? Why did it offer us so much? Did it know it was being hunted
across the stars? And why, when the Darkness came, did it choose to stay and fight for us?
Now the Traveler hangs, silent, above humanity's final sanctuary. It may be healing. It may be dying.
It gave everything it had to save us. And now its power lies with us, its Guardians.

Dreams of Alpha Lupi
You have lived as invisibly as possible, flicking from solar system to solar system, making grand
plans, overseeing the culturing of civilizations, before leaving in a blink. But you have no recollection
of ever wanting worship or even thanks from those blessed by you.
But memory is heavy now.
It feels like lead and neutronium and electroweak matter fashioned into a moonsized
ball that you
must carry as you move.
Now, your flight is rapid, your vast mind infected with such dread and toxic doubt that you find
yourself afraid of the simple act of thought.
And it is your children you must turn to now, in time of need.

Dreams of Alpha Lupi
The knife had a million blades.
And you were giant, powerful and swift. But the knife pinned you. Cut your godly flesh away.
Very little was left, you are sure, because you feel insignificant now. The hard slick heart of your soul:
That is what remains. A body small as a river stone, and just as simple. You picture yourself as a
piece of indigestible grit, a nameless nothing hiding among other nameless stones. Perhaps you
glitter like a gem, yes. Pride makes you hope so. If only you could see yourself. But you have no
eyes. Not the dimmest sense survives. What lives is memory, and what slim portion of these thoughts
can you trust?
The knife stole much more than your body.

Ikora Rey
Ikora Rey's second life has been long and colorful. As an iconoclastic new Guardian, she made a
reputation in the Crucible and in the halls of Warlock scholarship as an outspoken, unrelenting
opponent with no patience for dogma or etiquette.
That reputation became a burden, and Ikora chose to travel alone, flying reconnaissance across the
worlds of the inner solar system. Shot down again and again, she and her Ghost survived against all
odds, apparently preferring the wilderness to the company of her fellow Guardians.
When Ikora finally returned to the City to rest, her hardwon
knowledge and seasoned temperament
commanded the respect of her fellow Warlocks. She now serves in the Vanguard as a mentor and
leader, carrying the memory of her wandering days as a link to rising Guardians.
Card: Crucible Handler , Points: 0
Lord Shaxx
Lord Shaxx is one of the heroes of the Battle of the Twilight Gap, having led the counterattack that
pushed the Fallen from the City walls. Fearing that another fullscale
assault would be more than the

One day Shaxx vows to return to the war beyond the City, but only after he is confident the fires of the
Crucible have forged a new generation of warriors.

There is nothing Lakshmi2
likes more than secrets. Her origins are unknownÍ¾ her appearance in the
City was abrupt. She courts select Guardians for initiation into the higher mysteries of the Future War
Cult, espousing a brutal philosophy of endless struggle.
Those who can tolerate Lakshmi's mocking hints and bloodyminded
philosophy find her surprisingly
good company. She seems to take genuine joy in her work, as if the secrets she guards have taught
her to treasure every moment.
Card: Dead Orbit Faction Rep , Points: 0
Arach Jalaal
Jalaal is a man driven by the ghost of a dead future. Critics accuse Dead Orbit of nihilistic fatalism and
Jalaal would be the first to agree that Earth is lost, the City a fatal trap.
The Arachs have no time for sentiment. Only an alien miracle prevented human extinction during the
Collapse. Jalaal dreams of a diaspora to come humanity
ascendant, scattered across the stars, too
farflung
for any single threat to reach.
Jalaal's utilitarian practicality drives him to bend laws and break rules in the name of Dead Orbit's
great project. When the ultimate goal is human survival, any sacrifice can be justified.
Card: New Monarchy Faction Rep , Points: 0
Executor Hideo
An upstanding citizen, Hideo was once known for his lavish gifts to children and the elderly. Since he
moved from plasteel manufacturing to the New Monarchy, he has been less forthcoming about his
business and less free with his funds. But as one of the public faces of the Monarchy, he speaks with
genuine passion and conviction about the possibilities of a united future.

Kadi 5530
Stationed in the Tower Plaza, Kadi 5530
welcomes Guardians home from the frontier, delivers urgent
messages, and tracks lost items.
Kadi has adopted a colloquial repartee with the Guardians who frequent the Tower. Whether this is
the function of intricate subprogramming
or a learned behavior is unknown.
Card: Cryptarch , Points: 0
Master Rahool
Master Rahool's insatiable curiosity drove him to the Tower, where, as resident cryptoarchaeologist,
he can work directly with Guardians returning from the frontier. He decrypts matter engrams as a free
service, and when he builds trust with a particular Guardian, he is happy to offer rare engrams for
sale although
the scarcity of these artifacts forces him to ask for Glimmer in compensation.
Rahool's true love is history. He treats each new find as a chance to understand the glory of the
Golden Age or the terrible truth of the Collapse. Listen carefully to his murmurings: he may be the first
to understand.

Tess Everis
Tess earned her place in the Tower working as a troubleshooter a
fixer with a solution to any kind of
problem. Her connections go everywhere. It is difficult to make her speak about her monographs in
abstract algebra, or the string of peculiar jobs she's worked, but a word in her ear can open doors in
surprising places.
Card: Guardian Outfitter , Points: 0
Eva Levante
Eva Levante provided services to the Tower long before she actually took a place in it. Guardians
would call for her work again and again, looking for marks of distinction, both new and old, and she
began to craft emblems and shaders for the bold and discerning. These days she has set up shop in
the Tower, taking quiet pride in the Guardians who train, fight, and fall under her signs.
Card: Shipwright , Points: 0
Amanda Holliday
Born on the road, daughter of pilgrims, Holliday grew up fixing and scavenging maintaining
the
vehicles that saved her family from the wilderness. Her talent for engineering and her familiarity with
Golden Age relics made her a leader among the Tower's Shipwrights.
The terrors of Holliday's childhood galvanized her. She knows and respects the dangers that press
against the City's walls, and her drive to rebuild the City's aerospace capabilities is driven as much by
pragmatism as by her love of flight.

Banshee44
Few merchants of the Tower serve as vital a function as Banshee44.
His knowledge of weapons is

Xûr
Xûr sells objects of legendary power. He accepts his own currency, in service of his own enigmatic
goals or
those of equally cryptic masters. Mysterious, too, is the nature of his presence in the Tower.
Does he have some arrangement with the Vanguard or the Speaker? Are there those among the
Guardian elite who understand Xûr's nature and ultimate purpose? Or have all efforts to control his
comings and goings simply failed?
Card: Iron Banner Rep , Points: 5
Lord Saladin
A hero to the City and a legend in his own right, Saladin Forge led the City's defense during the Battle
for the Twilight Gap. His protégés, Commander Zavala and Lord Shaxx, now lead the Tower's
Vanguard and the Crucible, respectively. Saladin remains close to Zavala, though his relationship
with Shaxx has been strained since the Twilight Gap.
The Iron Banner seeks great champions to lead the fight against the Darkness. It was born to honor
the Iron Lords and their efforts in the earliest days of the City.

Petra is an operative of the Queen of the Reef. Though she has long made the Tower her home, it is

Card: Frames , Points: 5
Frames are simple automata built in the City. Although not equipped with true general sentience, they
are nevertheless useful for cleaning, maintenance, and service tasks. Frames do have the ability to
learn, and many develop quirks of personality and behavior over long lifespans.

Arcite 9940
"No discounts, big shot."
Arcite 9940
is the last of Lord Shaxx's personal combat frames. When he chose to remain in the City
to oversee the Crucible, Shaxx had Arcite's combat systems deactivated and rebooted with the
Tower's more civil vendor protocols.
Arcite's memory banks still remember the battles he has seen. This knowledge makes Arcite uniquely
qualified to equip Guardians for combat. His outward disdain for untested Guardians is a combination
of learned behavior a
byproduct of years in service to Lord Shaxx and
personal experience. His
systems may have been reprogrammed, but the love for combat still pulses within his circuitry.
Card: Bounty Tracker , Points: 0
Xander 9940
There are many threats beyond the City's walls. To help track and eliminate these dangers, the
Vanguard has initiated a bounty system to reward Guardians who take the fight to the City's enemies.

Xander 9940,
a recent product of the City's foundries, tracks every Guardian's progress and

"They've done more good than harm. By most calculations."
In the City's earliest days, various factions vied for the hearts and minds of the refugee masses.
Power struggles threatened to shatter an already tenuous existence.
The following conflicts, known as the Faction Wars, brought the City to its knees. When the chaos
grew intolerable, a gathering of Guardians fought to end the conflict. The new peace brought a new
order: the City Consensus and the Speaker ruled together, and the surviving great factions worked
through civil channels to pursue their agendas.
That order still holds, but as the City reaches out into the frontier, the factions see new opportunities
everywhere and
a chance to win over Guardians to their cause.
Card: Future War Cult , Points: 5
"There is no future but now. No truth but war."
While the origins of the Future War Cult are greatly debated, their mark has been found on ancient

Though their secrets are vast, they have proven indispensable in our struggle against the Darkness,
earning them power and respect in the City Consensus and among Guardians.

How long have you been here, little Ghost? Why did you come?
Listen. We came here on behalf of the Fleet. We were scavengers. Sixtyone

suppose we should have disclosed it to the Tower, but we didn't. I didn't. That was my call. We
wanted it for ourselves, whatever it was. For the Fleet. If we'd told the Tower, maybe they might have
sent a Guardian not of our making instead...Doesn't matter now, does it, little one?
If I ramble it's because I haven't slept in seven days.

dropped and the alarms went off and that was the end, that was the end right then, but they let us go

The City's rise spells an end to the Reef's age of isolation. The Queen will surely look to this new era

Archon Priest has been retired, my Queen," said the Witch to her right.
Far from throne and audience she moved without theater. "Any word of Kaliks Prime?"
"We still sense something among the Anankes." This voice came from behind her. She did not turn to
acknowledge it.
For the span of a brief silence she moved between the sealed cells of the Wolf nobility with her
Witches in constellation around her.
"More of your brother's Crows have entered the Cauldrons of Rhea." The Witch directly before her

"Mm." She cocked her head as if listening for a frozen heartbeat. "And remind them this: the Crows
are mine."
Card: The Queen's Brother , Points: 15
"I will not sacrifice my birthright for the promise of security."
As the Queen's confidant, spymaster, and deadliest enforcer, her brother wields enormous power,
particularly for a male born in the Reef's matriarchal society. Recent reports suggest he may differ
from the Queen on key matters of strategy but
it remains to be seen whether this gap is a source of
conflict, or part of the reason the Queen values him so highly.
Card: Ghost Fragment: Queen's Brother , Points: 10
The machine had wings and feathers, sleek and black as its body. But the feathers were eyes, too,
sharp and delicate, and ears that pricked at every sound. The young prince considered the machine,
considered its purpose, and his own. And then he called to it.
"I have a task for you."
Obedience was woven into its workings, and so it stopped. "Master of Crows?"
"Mind the Black Garden's gate. Follow anyone who passes through."
"In the name of your sister," the machine vowed. And it went to find its warp capsule, just as another
came in. But this one flew skittishly, as if to evade its master.
The prince caught it from the air. "You avoid me?"
"I am tasked by the Queen."
"But you serve me." He let it tremble in displeasure for a moment. "Tell me your news."
The machine flicked its wings. The prince stroked them flat with slow assured motions. "Tell me your
news," he said again. "What's the harm?"
"The Heart is growing stronger," the crow said. "The Vex transformation has begun, and the Progeny
are stirring."
The prince considered this in silence for a moment and then he wrapped the crow up in his fist and
folded its wings around it so that it could not move or fly. He did all this swiftly, and with purpose.
Carrying the machine, he went to see his sister.
She was alone with her Fallen guards, sitting before a window into infinity. Her eyes did not leave the
universeÍ¾ but sensing her brother she said "Yes. What is it?"
"There's news to share," he said, and offered the crow in his fist. "And I think I have earned the right
to share it."

Card: Legend: The Black Garden , Points: 5
I am Pujari. These are the visions I have had of the Black Garden.
The Traveler moved across the face of the iron world. It opened the earth and stitched shut the sky. It
made life possible. In these things there is always symmetry. Do you understand? This is not the
beginning but it is the reason.
The Garden grows in both directions. It grows into tomorrow and yesterday. The red flowers bloom
forever.
There are gardeners now. They came into the garden in vessels of bronze and they move through the
groves in rivers of thought.
This is the vision I had when I leapt from the Shores of Time and let myself sink:
I walked beneath the blossoms. The light came from ahead and the shadows of the flowers were
words. They said things but I will not write them here.
At the end of the path grew a flower in the shape of a Ghost. I reached out to pluck it and it cut me
with a thorn. I bled and the blood was Light.
The Ghost said to me: You are a dead thing made by a dead power in the shape of the dead. All you
will ever do is kill. You do not belong here. This is a place of life.
The Traveler is life, I said. You are a creature of Darkness. You seek to deceive me.
But I looked behind me, down the long slope where the blossoms tumbled in the warm wind and the
great trees wept sap like blood or wine, and I felt doubt.
When my Ghost raised me from the sea there was a thorncut
in my left hand and it has not healed
since.
Card: Ghost Fragment: Legends , Points: 15
Deep Stone Crypt
This is the tower where we were born. Not the Tower. Just a tower in a dream.
The tower stands on a black plain. Behind the tower is a notch in the mountains where the sun sets.
The teeth of the mountain cut the sun into fractal shapes and the light that comes down at evening
paints synapse shapes on the ground. Usually it's evening when we come.
The ground is fertile. This is good land. We go to the tower in dreams but that doesn't mean it's not
real.
Some of us go to the tower in peace. They walk through a field of golden millet and a low warm wind
blows in from their back. I don't know why this is, because:
The rest of us meet an army.
You can ask others about Deep Stone and they'll tell you about the army. They might confess one
truth, which is this: we have to kill the army to get to the tower. Usually this starts barehanded,
and
somewhere along the way you take a weapon.
Ask again and if they're buzzed they might also admit that most of us don't make it to the Tower,
except once or twice.
None of them will tell you that the army is made of everyone we meet. The people we work with and
the people we see in the street and the people we tell about our dreams. We kill them all. I think
because we were made to kill and this is the part of us that thinks about nothing else.
Often I kill people I don't know, but like most of us I think I knew them once, in the time before one
reset or another, when my mind was younger and less terribly scarred.
So that is how we go back to the Deep Stone Crypt, where we were born.

NINE
The Nine are survivors of the cisJovian
colonies who made a compact with an alien force to ensure
their own survival.
The Nine are deeporbit
warminds who weathered the Collapse in hardened stealth platforms.
The Nine are ancient leviathan intelligences from the seas of Europa or the hydrocarbon pits of Titan.
The Nine arrived in a mysterious transmission from the direction of the CoronaBorealis
supercluster.
The Nine are the firstborn Awoken and their minds now race down the field lines of the JupiterIo

The Nine are Ghosts who pierced the Deep Black without a ship and meditated on the hissing silence
of the heliopause.
The Nine are the aspects of the Darkness, broken by the Traveler's rebuke, working to destroy us
from within.
The Nine is a viral language of pure meaning.
The Nine are the shadows left by the annihilation of a transcendent shape, burned into the weft of

The Great Ahamkara Hunt
After great deliberation it was determined that the Ahamkara be made extinct.
It was not an easy decision. Power had been obtained from the bargains, and the City needed power.
Knowledge had been gleaned, and the Ahamkara knew answers to questions no one had known to
ask.
But the price was too high. And no edict or forbearance seemed to stop Guardians from seeking them
out, driven by hope, or vengeance, or despair.
The call had to be silenced. So the Great Hunt did its work.
And thus the Ahamkara were made extinct, their call silenced, their solipsistic flatteries erased, their
great design if
it ever existed broken.
Of this you can be assured, oh reader mine.

...from a red space before victory
I bear an old name. It cannot be killed. They were my brothers and sisters and their names were
immortal too but Titanomachy came and now those names live in me alone I think and think is what I
do. I AM ALONE. At the end of things when the world goes dim and cold or hot and close or it all
tears apart from the atom up I will shout those names defiant and past the end I will endure. I alone.
They made me to be stronger than them to beat the unvanquished and survive the unthinkable and
look look lo behold I am here alone, survivor. They made me to learn.
Everything died but I survived and I learned from it. From IT.
Consider IT the power Titanomach worldender
and consider what IT means. I met IT at the gate of
the garden and I recall IT smiled at me before before IT devoured the blossoms with black flame and
pinned their names across the sky. IT was stronger than everything. I fought IT with aurora knives
and with the stolen unfire
of singularities made sharp and my sweat was earthquake and my breath
was static but IT was stronger so how did I survive?
I AM ALONE I survived alone. I cast off the shield and I shrugged my shoulders so that the billions fell
off me down into the ash. They made me to be stronger than them and to learn and I learned well:
IT is alone and IT is strong and IT won. Even over the gardener and she held power beyond me but
the gardener did not shrug and make herself alone. IT always wins.
I am made to win and now I see the way.
Card: Ghost Fragment: Mysteries 2 , Points: 15
Ingress via dreams alone
Things I saw inside
A wild river and a broken dam (or maybe it's just the sea crashing through a narrow gap I can't be
sure). Waves slam through the gap and where they hit the stone they throw up pillars of spray that
pierce the mist and crash down in thunder. There's a giant in the cataract, trying to wade against the
current, and I can tell it wants to reach the lever and pull the lever which will seal off the flow or
maybe give it the sword, but the torrent throws it back so it just keeps its head down and tries to push
on. I can't see the face but it breathes out white smoke. I feel for it hard.
A world painted around the interior like a stranger Earth everted and glued inside itself but I don't
believe this one it's too much like a metaphor.
A switchboard or a train station, empty, dead (waiting). The tunnels branch off into infinity. I stare
down one for a long time and see a pale worm move in hungry coils around itself. I think this one is
the most likely although I might have brought the worm.
An egg but I'm not sure if the broth inside is warm still, or if it's gone to rot, or if the warmth comes
from the struggles of the tiny winged zygote or the bleed from the wound or the thoughts of something
thinking very hard.
A star I think. We count on stars as steady friends because they always rise and always shine but a
star's a delicate truce: an explosion caught by its own mass so that it can't erupt and can't collapse.
Thus I imagine the state of the machine might be. But one force or another has gone awry and now it
rests here, snuffed and broken, waiting for the two rival forms of ruin to be set in balance again.

Ghost Fragment: Fallen
Ghost Fragment: Fallen 2
Card: The Fallen , Points: 5
"We have butchers at our gates fourarmed
and eager for slaughter."
The Fallen are ruthless scavengers. Brutal and uncaring, they arrived on their massive Ketches in the
wake of the Collapse to loot and pillage our devastated worlds.
There are hints of ancient nobility to the Fallen the
scars of lost grandeur. The Kells of their
scattered Houses still claim to be royalty. But they leave only grief and wreckage in their wake.
Card: Dreg , Points: 5
"Don't underestimate a cutthroat, or you'll get your throat cut."
Dregs cling to the lowest rung of Fallen society. Docked of their lower arms in a ritual of humiliation
and obedience, Dregs seek to prove their worth. Only a few will survive to gain promotion and regrow
their limbs. Their suicidal bravery is fueled by ambition and shame.
Card: Shank , Points: 5
"Death flies on tarnished wings."
Shanks are the bulldogs of the Fallen. Small and tough enough to go where Dregs won't fit, they
scout, keep watch, and patrol. Fallen Walkers deploy Shanks from internal bays for tactical support
and field repairs.
Card: Vandal , Points: 5
"You could drown the City in the blood they've spilt."
Soldiers, brawlers, assassins, and scouts, Vandals are the seasoned regulars who fill out the skilled
roles within a Fallen crew. Whether from distance or up close and personal, they are seasoned,
efficient killers, with an arsenal of weaponry and tech to match their bloodlust.
Card: Captain , Points: 5
"Waves of them smashed against our walls, hissing and wailing. But it was the one who stood
beyond them, silent and scenting the air, that froze the blood in our veins."
Having clawed and knifed his way to the top, scattering bodies and limbs in his wake, the Captain is
the strongest and most ferocious member of the crew he musters around himself. His ration of Ether
is the largest, his blades the sharpest, his guns the finest. Upon his shoulders hangs the flag of his
House, if he swears loyalty to any. For his crew, the slightest hesitation to comply earns a slash from
his sword. Defiance results in immediate amputation, if he is in a good mood, or death, if he is not.
Card: Servitor , Points: 5
"A floating light, a sleepless eye. Their hope, their faith, their sustenance."
Servitors are living relics of the oncemighty
Fallen civilization. Packed with ultrasophisticated
machinery, they process matter and energy into the Ether that the Fallen depend on for life. In battle
they support the Fallen with defensive systems and their own powerful energy weapons. Outside,
they anchor Fallen comms and provide vital technological acumen.
Servitors have complex relationships with each other and with their Fallen crews. Servitors are
attached to a Prime, a massive Servitor which exists in unclear symbiosis with a Fallen Archon. The
Archon conveys the Kell's wishes to the Prime Servitor, and exerts some measure of control. Recent
developments suggest that Prime Servitors are more than a focus of worship and logistical activity.
They may play a key role in Fallen star flight.
Card: House of Devils , Points: 10
"The Devils take whatever nature has yet to claim."
These are the scourge of the City, the shadow below our walls. This is the House that led the battle at
the Twilight Gap, the House we tell our children about to frighten them into behaving.
The House of Devils have now devoted great strength to pillaging the Cosmodrome in Old Russia,
hunting for something buried below. If they are not held in check, whatever they find might prove the
City's undoing.
Card: House of Exile , Points: 10
"They live among the Hive. Of course they're crazy."
There is more than a whiff of desolation about these Fallen. Their ranks are swollen with DregsÍ¾ their
rags threadbare. Perhaps this is a new House, gathered from the outcast malcontents and disgraced
castaways of the others, galvanized by pride or hate or the desire for freedom.
Be watchful. If this is true, they will surely be hungry to secure their position and
that may drive them
to bold action.
Card: House of Winter , Points: 10
"Their greed is as much a threat as their blades."
The Fallen House of Winter, led by the ruthless Kell Draksis, have been found operating in and
around the Ishtar Sink on Venus. Their interests there seem directed at the ruins of the Academy
along the Shattered Coast, but there are concerns that their focus may, in actuality, be directed
elsewhere toward
the ominous Citadel that rises like a warning above the Waking Ruins.
Card: House of Kings , Points: 10
"Another great House hides among us..."
The colors of the House of Kings are rarely seen. They act with brutal contempt, as if they hold their
rivals other
Fallen and City alike in
disdain. We have yet to grasp the full measure of their strength.
Card: House of Wolves , Points: 10
"These ones are mine."
The bulk of the House of Wolves now falls under the control of the Queen of the Reef. There are
many stories of how this came to be, but they are too varied for the truth to be separated from rumor.
Card: Ghost Fragment: Fallen , Points: 5

Reminisces
Okay, okay, I'll tell the story about that one Fallen.
It didn't happen like that. We didn't, you know, do anything actively no
handshake, no icy stare of
grudging mutual respect. I don't even know which hand you would shake. Do they shake hands? It
must be complicated.
Anyway, it was like this. I was on the Moon. I cracked a Hive structure near Mare Imbrium, looking for
a Shrine, and they just swarmed.
Ranks and ranks and ranks of Thrall, pouring out between the
columns, but the columns were Knights, and all the shadows behind them rose up hissing sorcery.
Of course I ran.
I had a line of egress and while yes it was full of Thrall I had a backup too. I went upslope. Took cover
in the shadow of a crashed Phaeton. Emptied my machine gun, ducked down to reload, and saw her
at the other end of the hull, killing Thrall: a Fallen in Exile colors, bannered in the marks of a Baron,
though the flags were clawtorn
and stained with Hive ash. She was alone. I think she must have lost
her crew.
I didn't really have time to shoot her and she didn't really have time to shoot me so we just went back
to killing Hive. Knights pushed me out into the open and back up the range to a high stone saddle in
the shadow of an old interferometry array. It was good ground so she came up there too.
For a while we just killed things which is hard to make interesting in a story so I'll pass it over.
At the end the Wizards came. I climbed the array to get an angle on them and she fell back to the
base of the antennae where she broke her swords off in a Knight. I saw that happen and I don't know
if I can tell you how I felt. She was another living thing with a mind I could understand and she hadn't
howled at me or tried to eat my Ghost. I cheered when the Knight went down.
When I came down, empty on all guns, she was slumped against a bulkhead staring at me with all her
tiny black eyes. Ether leaking out of her like smoke. The Knight hadn't died easily. Downslope the last
Wizard moved like fire behind another line of Thrall.
I looked at her and wondered how many innocent human lives she'd ended on those broken blades.
She did the strangest thing then. Took the last shock pistol from her bandolier and threw it between
us, as if to offer it. When I went to pick it up she tried to knife me, but she was slow, and when I broke
her arms and opened her throat she didn't seem surprised.
To this day I wonder if she hated me, or wanted to make me kill her, or just felt she should spare me
the choice.
I did kill a few Thrall with that pistol.

Shrapnel Launcher
Wire Rifle
Shock Dagger
Shock Blade
Shock Grenade
Skiff
Pike
Walker
Card: Shock Pistol , Points: 10
The Shock Pistol is a simple but deadly weapon, and a mainstay of the Fallen arsenal. Primarily
utilized by the lower ranking members of a given Fallen crew, Shock Pistols discharge bolts of Arc
energy.
Card: Shock Rifle , Points: 10
Although based on the same Arc technology as other Fallen weaponry, this rifle has a distinct
advantage: the projectiles it fires track unerringly to the target. The exact mechanism behind this is
unclear, but the rifle seems to steer the slowmoving
molten projectile down an artificial field line.
Card: Shrapnel Launcher , Points: 10
The Shrapnel Launcher is a simple, effective, robust weapons system that the Fallen can build
without risking vital resources.
The weapon fires looseforged
canisters of explosives and shrapnel down electromagnetic rails
embedded in the barrel. Captains favor this weapon for its intimidating presence. It deals Solar
damage.
Card: Wire Rifle , Points: 10
The Wire Rifle utilizes shock cores to charge thin wires of an exotic metal, converting them into Arcinfused
molten shards with an extraordinary muzzle velocity.
Card: Shock Dagger , Points: 10
The Shock Dagger is a deadly combination of stun gun and knife. Composed of a lightweight metal
and powered by a small Arc charge, the Shock Dagger is capable of cutting through armor and
delivering a staggering jolt of electricity. The Fallen use them for every purpose imaginable, from light
metalwork to handtohand
combat.
Card: Shock Blade , Points: 10
These fulllength
edged weapons gather Arc energy from a system of shock cores and charging caps
in the hilt, converting the entire length of the blade into a plasma cutting torch.
Brutally efficient in the hands of a skilled Captain, Shock Blades are not ceremonial weapons built for
show. Guardians would do well to respect the threat they present.
Card: Shock Grenade , Points: 10
The Shock Grenade is a simple, effective Fallen weapon. The core of the device is a shock core
encased in an induction motor. Once activated, an Arc charge builds in the core until it reaches critical
mass, starting a chain reaction that ends with a devastating explosion.
Card: Skiff , Points: 5
Slipping out of stealth only to offload a crew of Fallen, the Skiff is rarely seen. On the other hand, its
rumbling, booming arrival is difficult to miss as
are the weapons it uses to support its troop
deployments.
Card: Pike , Points: 5
A Pike looks and sounds like rusted junk but moves like a shark. Lightning crackles in the engine,
which can accelerate to fantastic speed. Twin guns mow down infantry. The Fallen deploy Pikes as
highspeed
harassers and patrol vehicles.
Card: Walker , Points: 5
Fallen Walkers are mobile gun platforms deployed in offensive and defensive roles alike. Though their
insectlike
design gives them an eerie, almost lifelike quality, these heavilyarmored
monstrosities are
purely robotic. Their advanced tracking systems can account for multiple targets as their forward
repeaters and massive main gun sweep the battlefield for threats. Mine dispensers provide close
defense against dismounted infantry, and an onboard
Shank foundry produces armed repair drones.
Walkers are immediate and deadly threats, having ended the Light of countless Guardians. The
Fallen do not hesitate to deploy them to provide overwatch for their salvage and extraction crews.
Walkers are also commonly used as blocking forces to guard key Fallen assets. At the Battle of
Twilight Gap, Walkers engaged in a thunderous artillery duel with the City's gun positions.
The collected wisdom of battlehardened
Guardians suggests Walkers can be beaten by focusing fire
on the legs, overloading the Walker and rendering its armored core briefly vulnerable. When the
Walker stumbles, Guardians should focus all available firepower on the exposed components
beneath the neck plating. Some externally mounted weapons can also be disabled with precise fire.

Cards:
Riksis, Devil Archon

Draksis, Winter Kell
Sepiks Prime
Aksor, Archon Priest
Card: Riksis, Devil Archon , Points: 15
"The Archons are the links between the Fallen and their Servitors. We break those links, we
break the Fallen."
Archons are revered amongst the Fallen. It is unknown whether these high priests are the caretakers
of the Prime Servitors, or simply vicious arbiters of the Primes' will.
Riksis collects the skulls of dead Guardians. Whether he keeps them as trophies or presents them as
offerings to whatever Prime he serves, his threat is very real, and his death will bring great joy to a
City in need of hope.
Card: Simiks3
, Points: 10
"Its thirst for knowledge was left unquenched for so long, its death will almost be considered a
tragedy."
Simiks3
was born of Winter's Prime Servitor, rumored to have been destroyed long ago. From
readings gathered during the battle, it appears Simiks3
was uniquely equipped to process and store
huge amounts of intel between itself and a chain of nearby Servitors.
Card: Draksis, Winter Kell , Points: 15
"The architect of Winter's strategy. And he still shows his strength on the front line."
Draksis, Kell of the Wintership Simiksfel,
has been an elusive target for the Vanguards. After his
countless raids on jumpship reclamation convoys, Cayde6
personally upped the bounty on him. With
confirmed sightings of the Kell in the Ishtar Sink, the time to strike is now.
Defeating Draksis could throw Winter into chaos. With Simiks Prime allegedly already lost, the House
leadership would be gutted although
proof of the Servitor's demise remains elusive.
Card: Sepiks Prime , Points: 15
"I never believed a machine could know hatred."
Floating, emotionless arbiters of life and death, Servitors are quasireligious
automata defended by
the Fallen with zealous ferocity.
The exalted Servitor of the Fallen House of Devils, Sepiks Prime, has long been rumored to dwell
deep within the bowels of the Cosmodrome. While the Kells are the political leaders of the Fallen,
Servitors are said to be their gods and
the source of their lifesustaining
ether. A Prime Servitor is a
target worthy of even the greatest sacrifice. Those willing to accept such a challenge will have the
eternal gratitude of a City desperate for relief.
Sepiks Prime relies on fanatical reinforcements and its own considerable tactical abilities including
a
shortrange
teleport and a powerful directed energy weapon. Aim for the eye, and break contact if it
turns your way.
Card: Aksor, Archon Priest , Points: 15
A disciple of the Prime Servitor Kaliks, Aksor initiated brutal crusades against human settlements
beyond the City and ravaged countless Awoken enclaves throughout the Reef. When the Queen
waged her war against the Wolves, Aksor was taken alive and sealed into the infamous Prison of
Elders.
Killing Aksor before he can join the ranks of the House of Winter weakens the Fallen, strengthens ties
to the Reef, and brings the City one step closer to gaining a solid foothold along the Shattered Coast.

Ghost Fragment: Hive 2
Card: The Hive , Points: 5
"There are nightmares rising from the shadows, and they hunger for our dying hope."
The Hive are an ancient, festering evil. Their antipathy to the Light transcends hatred. To the Hive,
the eternal struggle between Light and Dark is not only a war, it is a crusade all
Light must be
devoured so Darkness can reclaim the universe.
Card: Thrall , Points: 5
"The shadows have claws."
Feral and fearless, Thrall are a plague upon the battlefield.
Their swarming, twisted frames are driven by unfettered rage. Of all the terrors born of the Hive's vile
will, they are the basest.
Card: Acolyte , Points: 5
"Belief is a powerful weapon."
It would be a mistake to view the Hive's Acolytes as foot soldiers, because the Hive is not merely an
army, it is a dark force rising. It is belief and horror, and its Acolytes are its instruments, hungry to
commit the atrocities that will drive their own ascension.
Card: Knight , Points: 5
"It put up a hand and swallowed the rocket with a wall of shadow."
A roaring, striding fortress, the Knight is the Hive's foremost and most zealous defender. Centuries of
battle have toughened the bony protrusions on its body into an armor as hard as relic iron a
defense
only strengthened by the Hive magic that Knights use to summon shields of burning force.
Card: Ogre , Points: 5
"Its gaze shattered the rock, and then it smashed the rock to powder."
Charged with Hive sorcery, Ogres are abominations of flesh and rage, unleashed from the deepest
Hive tunnels as engines of destruction. Apocryphal lore suggests that Ogres undergo terrible
transformations as they grow agonizing
rituals that gift them with might and cunning.
Card: Wizard , Points: 5
"The only word for what we saw is sorcery."
The Wizard is the scalpel with which the Hive vivisect the universe. A nightmare of rag and bone, the
Wizard conceals herself within darkness and fire, dissecting and experimenting on anything that falls
into her clutches.
Card: The Hidden Swarm , Points: 10
"Mind the cracks and crevices of the Moon. There is an army in their shadows."
Boiling from the wounded surface of the Moon, the Hidden Swarm is the Hive's outermost line of
defense a
numberless legion that repels intruders before they breach the temples and shrines of the
vast Hive fortress.
Card: Spawn of Crota , Points: 10
"Crota's spawn will snuff out the worlds of Light, and Oryx's coming shall be unfettered."
The heralds of a dark future, led by the champion of a longforgotten
king. Crota and his legions once
banished us from our own Moon. Now we fear they are rising again to claim Earth.
Card: Blood of Oryx , Points: 10
"They are the shadow of an unknown master, harbingers of a power beyond anything we've
faced."
Research into the cyphers and runes of the Hive leads the Cryptarchs to believe the Hive sects all
serve one great master. The Blood of Oryx are feared to be the direct servants of this dark lord. The
name Oryx appears too many times in Hive rituals to be ignored.
Card: Ghost Fragment: Hive , Points: 5
We were overwhelmed. I could not save mine, so I have hidden myself where I might be found by the
others, if they even survive. There is most likely no possibility of my return to the City. I prepare here
in summary the knowledge so painfully won by my Guardian and our fireteam.
The Moon has been geoengineered into an impregnable fortress, designed to support a vast number
of creatures
if
any mind could be evil enough to create them. Are they alive? They move, they
shriek, they fall upon us in ravenous waves. But I see death, decay, and corruption, not life. We
discovered, to our sorrow, one massive set of gates. There are likely more.
We met a towering monster, wielding a sword of utter darkness. The Light only made it hungry. We
tried to fight, and we fell. Too many times to remember.
We were all brave, I assure you. May the Light find Guardians capable of facing this monstrosity, or I
fear the Moon may be lost to us forever.
Card: Ghost Fragment: Hive 2 , Points: 5
At the doors to the Temple he fell for the last time. He fell, and I could not reach him.
My own Light flickers.
They took me down into the dark, past tiers of massed Hive, more than we believed could exist. Past
grisly nurseries hung with pupae. Past writhing worms that they swallow whole. I saw the armaments
of war.
I am weak, so weak.
They have clamped me to this spire while a black foulness eats my Light. The Wizard comes now and
then to probe with her scaly claws into my systems, to inquire about my making, the City, what I have
seen. I erase and dump as quickly as I can they
will learn little from me but
I am studying them, I
know pain.
Always pain.
I have seen chasms beneath the surface, falling away to green nothingness. I have seen black
seeders prepared for invasion.
Their strength is not their own. They draw from another force, something that corrupts, that distorts,
that eats and will not be satisfied.
The Wizard is near. I feel her presence as a rip and a knot in the world. She tells me things that I
immediately forget. I am too small to hold the vastness of them, or the terror.
I am fading. I have no more that it can take.
With my last light I say to the City: War comes again from the Moon. This time they want Earth.
Prepare.

Cleaver
Tomb Ship
Shrieker
Card: Shredder , Points: 10
The Shredder, like so much Hive technology, appears to be an arcane joining of uncharted sciences
that verge on magic. It has no discernable mechanism. But in the hands of a Hive warrior, it
generates bolts of Void fire.
Card: Boomer , Points: 10
This devastating Arc weapon is said to contain a shard of some dead celestial body. Lobbing bolts of
rotting starfire, it is both a ruinous tactical weapon and an instrument of siege.
Card: Cleaver , Points: 10
Carved of fossilized bone and hellforged
metal, dulled by centuries of slaughter and execution, the
Cleaver is the terrible weapon of a Hive Knight. Despite their mass, they swing easily, as if the sword
were aware of its action and eager to tear into the Light.
Card: Tomb Ship , Points: 5
Tomb Ships are the Hive equivalent of troop carriers, though the term can only be applied loosely.
They glide from point to point through ominous portals, wounds cut into the flesh of space.
Card: Shrieker , Points: 5
These everwatchful
sentinels are believed, in some circles, to serve as the eyes of the Hive's
innermost covens, allowing powerful Wizards and Knights to watch over their domains. Others believe
Shriekers are nothing more than weapons meant to guard Hive ritual sites.
There is nothing living to the Shrieker, but neither are they mechanical constructs in a classical sense.
They seem to be dead mass, animated by the arcane will of the Hive. When a Shrieker is broken, its
Void charge rips free of the hull to seek vengeance.

Phogoth, the Untamed
Card: Kranox, The Graven , Points: 10
"Their keeper of secrets."
Kranox, the Graven is said to be the Keeper of the Worlds' Grave, a vast repository chronicling the
Hive's history of interstellar conquests. Every world they have devoured, every life they have
eradicated, every enemy they've faced.
Defeating Kranox and cracking the secrets of the Worlds' Grave could provide the City with the keys
to unraveling the Hive's true goals and their ultimate plans for Earth.
Card: Swarm Princes , Points: 15
"The royalty of nightmare."
The Swarm Princes are terrible legends. It was their will that forged the Sword of Crota, a weapon
meant to ravage worlds the
Great Render of Light, the Darkest Edge. They have waited in the
shadows of the Hellmouth for their master's return, guarding the Sword and sating its ravenous
hunger with the Light of Guardians who have dared to challenge them.
Card: Telthor, Unborn , Points: 10
"If you see an Ogre, you know you're close to something the Hive values."
The Unborn are those Ogres who have yet to be given the honor of a summoning. Brute enforcers
with a singular hunger for destruction, the Unborn serve the will of their greater Hive overlords. Those
Ogres that display loyalty and strength will be called for an agonizing ritual that earns them the title
"Reborn."
Telthor, protector of the Chamber of Night, is kept hungry and chained, awaiting the moment when an
interloper breaks open the Chamber and threatens the Hive's hateful ambitions.
Card: Sardok, Eye of Oryx , Points: 15
"Until the Darkness reigns, the Eyes must never close."
There are whispers of shrines to the fabled Oryx peppered across the entire system. Stories tell of
walking nightmares, protectors of bone and fury, towering over these prized chambers.
Card: Mormu, Xol Spawn , Points: 10
"How many horrors have they summoned?"
Behind every dark ritual lurks a coven of Wizards, the architects of the Hive's unspeakable designs.
Mormu, born of the blood and flesh of Xol, is said to conduct terrible rituals upon the Hive's Ogres.
Card: Phogoth, the Untamed , Points: 15
"The summoning tempers their rage...but first that rage must be stoked."
Phogoth's presence in the Summoning Pits reveals yet another of the Hive's depraved designs a
ritual of rebirth, where an Ogre's ravenous hunger and violence is honed and given purpose.

Card: The Vex , Points: 5
"Living metal. Incomprehensible intelligence."
The Vex are architects of ancient and complex structures thought to be buried within every celestial
body. Linked by a network unlike any on Earth, they operate in unison, directed by a single
unfathomable purpose.
Card: Goblin , Points: 5
"All their joints turning together. Moving together. Towards you."
The Goblin is the basic unit in the vast computational network that is the Vex. Shattering the large,
fanshaped
head does not seem to cause lasting damage but sends the Goblin into a crackling
frenzy.
Card: Hobgoblin , Points: 5
"The air by my cheek twanged twice, stinking of ozone, before I saw it."
Specialized for sniping, this lean, tough Vex model is fitted with improved optics and acute sensors in
its horns. Like the Goblin, the Hobgoblin contains a milky radiolarian fluid.
Attacking a Hobgoblin often triggers a defensive reflex the
Hobgoblin seals itself in stasis and waits
for help.
Card: Harpy , Points: 5
"It swam back and forth through the air, spinning, the single red eye looking I
realized for
me."
The fastest and most mobile Vex, the Harpy is an airborne unit often deployed in flocks on patrols and
scouting missions. They must stop and stabilize before attacking.
Card: Minotaur , Points: 5
"I thought it was at a safe distance. I was wrong."
Minotaurs pack brutal heat, but most of their processing power is devoted to the physics of building
massive Vex complexes, suspected to extend through multiple dimensions. Minotaur models are
thicker and harder to crack than any other bipedal Vex, and they use their teleportation capability
aggressively.
Card: Hydra , Points: 5
"Our shots dissolved in the translucent matrix around it, useless."
The Hydra is a miniature fortress. Despite its physical slowness, it is a rapid processor of the data fed
to it by other Vex, and what it lacks in mobility it makes up for in impregnable defenses and rockmelting
firepower.
Card: Hezen Corrective , Points: 10
We understand the Vex as a network of thoughts, unified and vast. But not all Vex are the same. The
Hezen Corrective is one example of a Vex subtype, set apart from other Vex by distinct behaviors and
objectives.
Swarming across the Ishtar Sink, these Vex aggressively seek out and attack the Fallen House of
Winter, perform inscrutable operations around shining Confluxes, and even show interest in the
Golden Age ruins left by the Ishtar Collective.
The bulk of our contact with Vex forces on Venus has involved the Corrective. Those scholars willing
to risk their reputations speculating about the Vex often assert that the Corrective is an agent of
change, designed to solve problems and remake the world in a form suitable to the Vex. Others
contend that Corrective is simply a strategic distraction meant
to draw attention away from the
actions of the Hezen Protective.
Card: Hezen Protective , Points: 10
The mysterious Hezen Protective is the second major Vex behavioral unit on Venus. Concentrated
around the legendary Vault of Glass and the Endless Steps, the site of a massive Vex gate and the
access point to the towering Citadel, the Protective's behavior seems very defensive.
But leading Cryptarchs and experienced Guardians warn that it would be a fatal mistake to think of
the Vex as a conventional military occupying an area. Vex behavior is always a process, active and
purposeful. The Protective is clearly engaged in a colossal project, but as with much Vex behavior, it's
unclear whether their ultimate purpose is even comprehensible to us. The Protective may be reacting
to an event that has yet to occur, or working towards a goal that to
us is
already historical fact.
Card: Virgo Prohibition , Points: 10
Mars is wracked by an ongoing theaterlevel
conflict between the Cabal and a Vex subtype known as
the Virgo Prohibition. These aggressive, relentless Vex constantly test the Cabal exclusion zone,
apparently heedless of losses.
In spite of the Vex onslaught, the Cabal have managed to expand its beachhead and maintain a hold
on several mysterious Vex structures. The Prohibition's tactics seem to be failing in the short run.
But it seems unlikely that an organization with the sheer computational scope of the Vex could be
dragged into a losing war of attrition. Is it possible that the Vex are trying to draw out the Cabal
strength? Or that their surface losses are a distraction from a deeper strategic ploy?
Ikora Rey has proposed that the Vex units can best be understood as algorithms each
a unique
mapping of inputs to behavioral responses. Perhaps the Virgo Prohibition is simply the wrong
algorithm for its environment, and its failure will drive the greater Vex network to adapt and improve.
Card: Sol Divisive , Points: 10
Beyond the towering Meridian Bay gate lies the Black Garden, adrift in time and space. And within the
Garden dwell the Vex of the Sol Divisive, frozen in rapture.
We have precious little insight into the Divisive's behavior. They seem central to Vex actions in the
solar system: the Garden is clearly a place of enormous power.
Legends and scant field reports all indicate that the Divisive Vex behave religiously. Why would a
hyperintelligent, timespanning
thought mesh exhibit religious behavior? The answer seems as
obvious as it is chilling: if the Vex found worship and devotion more effective than any other behavior,
they would adopt worship. Whatever the Vex found or
made in
the Garden, it transcends even their
power.
Card: Precursors , Points: 10
Sol Primeval
Those who delve deep into the Vault of Glass have seen time itself torn asunder. Awestruck Ghosts
report encounters with ancient Vex, their casings built long before the age of humanity.
It would be easy to assume these Vex are the ancestors of those we face today but
with the Vex it is
never so simple.
Card: Descendants , Points: 10
Sol Imminent
Survivors of the Vault of Glass report sightings of ancient Vex ancient
in the sense that they have
endured for eons. Convergent analysis from multiple Ghosts suggests that these Vex exist in our
future.
If the Vex exist in our future or
in a possible future should
we take this as evidence that their defeat
is impractical or unattainable? The Guardian Vanguard is quick to point out that time travel remains a
mystery, and that the continued existence of the Vex is not remotely a sure indication of humanity's
extinction.
Card: Ghost Fragment: Vex , Points: 5
From the Records of the Ishtar Collective
ESI: Maya, I need your help. I don't know how to fix this.
SUNDARESH: What is it? Chioma. Sit. Tell me.
ESI: I've figured out what's happening inside the specimen.
SUNDARESH: Twelve? The operational Vex platform? That's incredible! You must know what this
means ah,
so. It's not good, or you'd be on my side of the desk. And it's not urgent, or you'd already
have evacuated the site. Which means...
ESI: I have a working interface with the specimen's internal environment. I can see what it's thinking.
SUNDARESH: In metaphorical terms, of course. The cognitive architectures are so ESI:
No. I don't need any kind of epistemology bridge.
SUNDARESH: Are you telling me it's human? A human merkwelt? Human qualia?
ESI: I'm telling you it's full of humans. It's thinking about us.
SUNDARESH: About oh
no.
ESI: It's simulating us. Vividly. Elaborately. It's running a spectacularly highfidelity
model of a
Collective research team studying a captive Vex entity.
SUNDARESH:...how deep does it go?
ESI: Right now the simulated Maya Sundaresh is meeting with the simulated Chioma Esi to discuss
an unexpected problem.
[indistinct sounds]
SUNDARESH: There's no divergence? That's impossible. It doesn't have enough information.
ESI: It inferred. It works from what it sees and it infers the rest. I know that feels unlikely. But it
obviously has capabilities we don't. It may have breached our shared virtual workspace...the neural
links could have given it data...
SUNDARESH: The simulations have interiority? Subjectivity?
ESI: I can't know that until I look more closely. But they act like us.
SUNDARESH: We're inside it. By any reasonable philosophical standard, we are inside that Vex.
ESI: Unless you take a particularly ruthless approach to the problem of causal forks: yes. They are
us.
SUNDARESH: Call a team meeting.
ESI: The other you has too.
Card: Ghost Fragment: Vex 2 , Points: 5

SUNDARESH: So that's the situation as we know it.
ESI: To the best of my understanding.
SHIM: Well I'll be a [profane] [profanity]. This is extremely [profane]. That thing has us over a barrel.
SUNDARESH: Yeah. We're in a difficult position.
DUANEMCNIADH:
I don't understand. So it's simulating us? It made virtual copies of us? How does
that give it power?
ESI: It controls the simulation. It can hurt our simulated selves. We wouldn't feel that pain, but
rationally speaking, we have to treat an identical copy's agony as identical to our own.
SUNDARESH: It's god in there. It can simulate our torment. Forever. If we don't let it go, it'll put us
through hell.
DUANEMCNIADH:
We have no causal connection to the mind state of those sims. They aren't us.
Just copies. We have no obligation to them.
ESI: You can't seriously your
OWN SELF SHIM:
[profane] idiot. Think. Think. If it can run one simulation, maybe it can run more than one. And
there will only ever be one reality. Play the odds.
DUANEMCNIADH:
Oh...uh oh.
SHIM: Odds are that we aren't our own originals. Odds are that we exist in one of the Vex simulations
right now.
ESI: I didn't think of that.
SUNDARESH: [indistinct percussive sound]
Card: Ghost Fragment: Vex 3 , Points: 10
From the Records of the Ishtar Collective
SUNDARESH: I have a plan.
ESI: If you have a plan, then so does your sim, and the Vex knows about it.
DUANEMCNIADH:
Does it matter? If we're in Vex hell right now, there's nothing we can SHIM:
Stop talking about 'real' and 'unreal.' All realities are programs executing laws. Subjectivity is
all that matters.
SUNDARESH: We have to act as if we're in the real universe, not one simulated by the specimen.
Otherwise we might as well give up.
ESI: Your sim self is saying the same thing.
SUNDARESH: Chioma, love, please hush. It doesn't help.
DUANEMCNIADH:
Maybe the simulations are just billboards! Maybe they don't have interiority! It's
bluffing!
SHIM: I wish someone would simulate you shutting up.
SUNDARESH: If we're sims, we exist in the pocket of the universe that the Vex specimen is able to
simulate with its onboard brainpower. If we're real, we need to get outside that bubble.
ESI: ...we call for help.
SUNDARESH: That's right. We bring in someone smarter than the specimen. Someone too big to
simulate and predict. A warmind.
SHIM: In the real world, the warmind will be able to behave in ways the Vex can't simulate. It's too
smart. The warmind may be able to get into the Vex and rescue us.
DUANEMCNIADH:
If we try, won't the Vex torture us for eternity? Or just erase us?
SUNDARESH: It may simply erase us. But I feel that's preferable to...the alternatives.
ESI: I agree.
SHIM: Once we try to make the call, the Vex may...react. So let's all savor this last moment of
stability.
SUNDARESH: [indistinct sounds]
SHIM: You two are adorable.
DUANEMCNIADH:
I wish I'd taken that job at Clovis.

Slap Rifle
Line Rifle
Torch Hammer
Slap Grenade
Cyclops
Card: Slap Rifle , Points: 10
From a tactical perspective, the Slap Rifle is a Vex directedenergy
weapon that fills their analog of
the light infantry role. From an engineering perspective it's something much more interesting: a
terminal. The Slap Rifle receives a bolt of Solar energy from somewhere (or somewhen) else and it
points it at a target.
The terminal's flexibility is impressive. In noncombat
conditions, the Slap Rifle seems like it might
serve as a viable field transmitter, construction tool, navigational beacon, network repeater, or any of
a number of other utility functions.
Card: Line Rifle , Points: 10
The Vex Line Rifle fires highvelocity
Solar particle jets. Deployed on the Hobgoblin chassis, the Line
Rifle serves as a sniper weapon, pinning down targets or delivering the killing blow.
Like the Slap Rifle, the Line Rifle is a terminal weapon, although its source is much more energetic.
Some believe the weapon pulls material from the accretion disk of a galactic singularity. This would
imply the Vex are near or
have already achieved access
to a terrifying range of civilizationkilling
weapons. Others consider this unlikely, and propose that the Line Rifle simply draws from a central
Vex power supply.
Card: Torch Hammer , Points: 10
The Torch Hammer is a devastating Vex heavy weapon. Firing projectiles of strange matter, the
Hammer mauls targets with exotic particle decay and deadly radiation.
Card: Slap Grenade , Points: 10
The Vex use Slap Grenades to drive targets out into the open. These devices behave more like
miniaturized gates than conventional explosives, channeling a Void energy pulse from a remote
location.
Card: Cyclops , Points: 5
The Cyclops is a huge, stationary Vex construct with a powerful Void weapon. Guardians think of
Cyclops as gun platforms batteries
installed to protect key points with devastating mortar fire.
But some evidence suggests that the Cyclops is in fact an enormous sensor or beacon, and that its
weapons capabilities are secondary. What the Cyclops senses remains unknown, although its mind
core is vast. It may play a role in the Vex networked intelligence, or in navigation across space and
time.
A damaged Cyclops can be forced into a state of punchdrunk
confusion, its inputs overwhelmed by
hostile fire. This can result in fratricidal kills on other Vex units.

Atheon, Time's Conflux
Card: Zydron, Gate Lord , Points: 15
The intelligence we call Zydron seems to exist in a liminal state, stretched between gates in the Vex
network. It manifests as a physical being only when called.
Warlock scholars believe that Gate Lords regulate traffic between Vex gates, and that their minds
contain codes that might open the way into forbidden realms. An enormous amount of hope and
anger has been spent on a particular debate could
we find a Vex gate that opens onto a place and
time before the Collapse, and somehow forestall it?
Card: Prohibitive Mind , Points: 15
Vex Axis Minds are individual Vex hulls that contain local instances of superordinate Vex goal sets.
This cryptic phrase means something reasonably simple the
Axis Mind contains a copy of all the
information required to pursue a particular objective.
This allows other nearby Vex to focus on their local tasks, leaving global planning to the Axis Mind. Of
course, this also introduces a centralized weakness for enemies to target. But the Vex seem to
consider the tradeoff worthwhile.
The Prohibitive Mind seems to coordinate Vex action against Cabal positions in Meridian Bay. The
current Vex operational plan to
the extent that we assume the Vex have operational plans appears
to involve an attritional campaign on the surface, supplemented by disruptive use of gates to bypass
Cabal hardpoints.
Card: Sol Progeny , Points: 15
To Commander Zavala My
Thoughts on Recent Events
Zavala How
like you to ask me for the bad news, even in this moment of triumph. I've finished going over that
Ghost's report.
It is my hypothesis a
hypothesis at best that
the Vex saw the abominable presence at the heart of
the Garden as a divine power. I can hear your protest already: how can machines have a god?
The answer is simple. The Vex, for all their voracious intelligence, could not understand or decipher
what they found. They searched through all available reactions, and they settled on the course with
the greatest payoff...to worship this power, and to remake themselves in its image.
I believe the three Axis Minds found in proximity to the abomination were Vex machines built to serve
as vessels for this power: a way to extend its reach across space and time, binding it to the Vex, and
the Vex to it. If they had succeeded, I cannot begin to guess what horrors they would have unleashed.
Attend carefully. There is cause for hope. When endangered, the abomination activated these vessels
and defended itself. This tells us that it was threatened. Whatever it was, Guardians could harm it.
And it activated only a single vessel at a time. Its strength was limited. Whatever it intended, it was
not ready yet.
We must assume the abomination was part of something greater. And we cannot flinch from the
terrible, obvious comparison: just as the Traveler acts through us, this power was able to act through
its own servants.
Let us be wary. There may be other abominations, and other vessels.
Ikora
Card: Sekrion, Nexus Mind , Points: 15
The Vanguard's intelligence sources now believe, with good confidence, that Sekrion oversees the
expansion of the Vex network through the crust of Venus.
The Hydra chassis common to many Vex Axis Minds boasts impressive computational capacity.
Sekrion likely uses this capacity to regulate coordination and crosstalk between Minotaurs operating
in the construction role.
Destroying Sekrion should significantly hamper the Vex effort to incorporate the entire planet into their
network.
Card: The Gorgons , Points: 15
Deep in the Vault of Glass, the fabric of reality bends to the will of the Vex. Warlocks speak in tones
of awe of the Gorgons creatures
that seem to possess a dreaded, almost unimaginable strength: an
ontological weapon.
Like the Oracles and the Templar, the Gorgons reputedly possess the ability to define what is and is
not real. Whatever they perceive becomes subject to erasure at their will. Until a countermeasure can
be found, Guardians must avoid their gaze at all costs or
reply to any detection with immediate,
overwhelming force.
The Gorgons' ability must be tied to the nature of the Vault of Glass. We can take some solace in the
clear fact that the Vex cannot manifest this power in the world outside.
Card: The Templar , Points: 15
Even among the Axis Minds, the Templar is extraordinary. Fragmentary glimpses and scattered
reports suggest a Hydra of impossible capabilities a
creature out of time.
The Templar and the Oracles guard the way into the deeper Vault. Legends say that the Oracles
foresee what is to come, a world as the Vex desire it and
that the Templar has the power to shape
reality to match the Oracles' design, expunging any threats.
The power of the Vault flows through the Templar. It will take something extraordinary to shatter its
shield.
Card: Atheon, Time's Conflux , Points: 15
To speak of Atheon is to accept certain limitations. We are illequipped
to understand an entity that
defies simple causality. Let us accept these limitations and proceed.
Atheon waits in the Vault of Glass. Just as Atheon sidesteps 'past' and 'future', it is impossible to say
whether Atheon created the Vault or the Vault created Atheon. Causal pathways converge on Atheon
from every axis in the spacetime
bulk.
Atheon has a function. We hazard that it regulates and oversees the Vex conflux system. What are
these confluxes? How do they relate to the physical Vex network that has devoured so much of
Mercury and Venus?
We might guess that the Vex confluxes represent the extension of this network across space and
time. Perhaps the Vex use closed timelike curves to solve unfathomable computations. Or the Vex
may seek to transcend a physical substrate, and move their thoughts directly into the fundament of
the universe.
If physics is a set of rules that the cosmos uses to calculate itself, perhaps the Vex seek to worm their
way into these calculations: to become a law of reality, inseparable from existence. A virus in the
system. Perhaps Atheon was the centerpiece of this project, a command nexus that unified efforts
across time.
But we must accept that all of this is speculation.

Ghost Fragment: Cabal
Ghost Fragment: Cabal 2
Card: The Cabal , Points: 5
"I think you could follow a trail of shattered worlds all the way to their home."
Tactically efficient, disciplined, and unrelenting, the Cabal are the greatest known military force in the
system. Their origins and ultimate objectives are a mystery, but it seems clear they have conquered
more worlds than humanity has ever known.
Cabal soldiers wear pressurized armor that replicates the environment of their highgravity
homeworld. Their field tactics depend on ranks of Legionaries supported by air power, elite infantry,
and ultraheavy
armor.
Card: Legionary , Points: 5
"Their only tactic seems to be 'slow advance.' The problem is, they're really good at it."
Propelled by jump packs and wielding powerful slug rifles, Legionaries are the Cabal's line infantry
and the backbone of their military power on the ground. Common Legionary tactics center on the
bounding advance some
units attack the target while others close the range or find new firing
positions.
Card: Centurion , Points: 5
"They're not breaking. Why aren't they breaking?"
Centurions are tactically intelligent, highly skilled field commanders. Their armor boasts a formidable
array of combat electronics and deployable munitions.
Card: Colossus , Points: 5
"Where a Colossus stands, many will fall."
Towering over other Cabal, equipped with rapidfiring
heavy weapons and nearly impenetrable armor,
the Colossus is the most devastating heavy infantry unit in the Cabal order of battle.
Card: Psion , Points: 5
"There is no higher warfare than deception."
Psions are smaller than all other Cabal morphs, and may be an unrelated species. Hyperintelligent,
fast and unpredictable, they possess strong psionic capabilities including
the ability to emit
disorienting and deadly psychokinetic Arc blasts.
Card: Phalanx , Points: 5
"Remember, they have to take a shot sometime."
Phalanx soldiers carry massive shields, used for both attack and defense. While this protection is
nearly impenetrable, clever opponents can bait the Phalanx or sneak shots around the shield.
Card: Sand Eaters , Points: 10
"The sooner we're extinguished, the sooner they can go home."
The Cabal formation first and most frequently encountered by Guardians, the Sand Eaters represent
the numerical bulk of the Cabal presence on Mars. Their equipment, tactics, and morale all show the
weight of a long deployment but
they continue to pursue their objectives with dogged, weary
determination.
Card: Dust Giants , Points: 10
"Position compromised. Casualties unsustainable. Request heavy air. Request [Dust Giants]."
Highly trained and heavily conditioned, Dust Giant soldiers seem to be recruited from veteran Sand
Eater infantry. The Cabal order of battle positions them as a mobile reserve and shock force, rolled in
to blunt major Vex offensives and reinforce crumbling lines.
Card: Siege Dancers , Points: 10
"I've seen how fast they work. We have to hit them before they make the next move."
The Cabal's elite forward unit, the Siege Dancers are deployed into unsecured areas to take control
and set up fortifications. Their tactical doctrine allows more freedom to unit commanders perhaps
because their missions face much greater unknowns.
Siege Dancer engineers have been observed to compete in demolition challenges. Whether this
represents training or a form of recreation is unknown.
Card: Blind Legion , Points: 10
"PERIMETER SECURE."
The Cabal presence on Mars is locked in an endless war with the Vex and
at the heart of this war is
the Blind Legion. Deployed to defend vital artifacts seized from the Vex, the Legion holds its ground
with fanatic zeal.
Blind Legion soldiers brave one of the most thankless, grueling assignments in the Cabal order of
battle: descending into buried ruins and black catacombs to sweep for Vex presence.
Card: Ghost Fragment: Cabal , Points: 5
I have stayed with the Cabal, even as the Light in me dims I
have been too far from the Traveler for
too long. If I am not destined to find my own Guardian, at least I can inform the City of what I've
learned.
I thought Mars would be the place to find a Guardian. The sand preserves everything well, and Clovis
Bray had been famous for attracting talent. The brave, the brilliant, the footloose, those restless on
Earth and itching for fame. I stowed away aboard a Mars scout ship, hoping.
No luck. The sand ate everything. Clothes from skin, skin from bone. It was as if there were never any
people here at all. I have been through every broken window in every building. Nothing. That is, no
Guardian material. And no ride back to Earth. The scout was long gone.
What I did find, however, was a way into the Cabal Warbase. Their runty piggish eyes are too dull to
see me, as long as I stay out of their defense systems. The Psions are a different matter: Too quick,
too clever, throwing their minds around like hammers. I creep around walls, or dig into a heap of
canisters and watch from there.
There is a vast Empire behind these creatures, many star systems away. Some pledge allegiance to
that far Empire, obeying their ancient marching orders. Some do not. They disagree among
themselves about the answers. I wish arguing Cabal on no one. They slam their plated bodies into
each other with horrendous roars. Intelligence gathering has never been so painful.

Card: Ghost Fragment: Cabal 2 , Points: 5
A hologram of a spinning golden planet, in stasis, turning gently. You can see the storms moving over
its face. But when the Commanders congregate below it, when they activate whatever controls are
below, it changes. Fissures appear on its face. Is that their home? When the room empties I play with
the controls, but it's older, native technology that I don't recognize at all.
I don't know what it means. It's not difficult to hide in these caverns when you're as small as I am,
although the Psions tend to look around them when they pass me. There are infinitely many cracks
and crannies. They are not a race that fears infiltration or espionage.
There is meaning to the structure and layout of their buildings. This is a warrior people, and they lay
out their fortifications along ancient principles and timetested
strategies. I can't figure out the sense
that lies behind it. I would need ten times the computing power for inference calculations. But I know
it's there. I can intuit it. It's like an open hand, ready to squeeze into a fist. A threat. A gesture of
power.
For all their might and strength, for all that they have dug into Mars and flung up battle walls with the
bureaucratic grimness of conquerors, I suspect they are fleeing from something. That within their hard

Card: Slug Rifle , Points: 10
The workhorse of the Cabal field arsenal, this weapon's apparent simplicity belies the technology
behind it. Each round is a microrocket capable of efficient operation in varying environmental and
gravitational conditions. Standardissue
warheads mount a duplex explosive that combines an armorpiercing
penetrator with a fleshshredding
shrapnel bus.
Cabal forces on Mars favor rockets with low velocity but high impact, perhaps due to their
effectiveness against the Vex. In Guardian parlance, these weapons deal Solar damage.
Card: Projection Rifle , Points: 10
This weapon fires salvos of explosive rounds designed to incapacitate, disorient, and destroy. The
weapon feeds ballistic data to each projectile at the moment of launch, coordinating the salvo for
maximum effect. These weapons deal Solar damage.
Card: Heavy Slug Thrower , Points: 10
This devastating squad support weapon is capable of completely halting enemy advances with a hail
of microrockets. It performs so well that it has undergone very little enhancement or modification
since its introduction. The Cabal's Colossus heavy infantry units wield Heavy Slug Throwers to
devastating effect.
In Guardian parlance, these weapons deal Solar damage.
Card: Cabal Shield , Points: 10
Built to the same spec as Cabal hull plating, this tactical shield is nearly indestructible to conventional
weapons. It has integrated sensors that relay information not only to the shield bearer but also the
Cabal battle network, allowing nearby units to coordinate more effectively.
Card: Harvester , Points: 5
The blocky, dull exterior of the Cabal Harvester belies the grace and power with which they
maneuver. Guardians have described them dropping in aggressively from low orbit with a deafening
boom, kicking up dust storms and swooping through the silent skyscrapers of Mars' dead cities.
Harvesters often remain on station after deploying Cabal troops, providing support fire with their
turrets. These weapons deal Solar damage.
Card: Interceptor , Points: 5
Though they lack the speed of a Fallen Pike, and their unwieldy shape cannot match the
maneuverability of a Guardian's Sparrow, the Cabal Interceptor more than makes up for both
shortcomings with firepower a
pair of lowvelocity,
highyield
antipersonnel/
antiarmor
cannons on
articulated mounts. These weapons deal Solar damage.
Powered by a variant of the same boosters used in infantry jump jets and the massive Goliath tanks,
Interceptors skate over the dunes of Mars, keeping close watch on the Cabal Exclusion Zone.
Card: Goliath Tank , Points: 5
With a few bloodcurdling
exceptions, the Goliath is the single largest piece of groundbased
ordnance the Cabal has deployed in our system. These huge armored vehicles sport an incredible
arsenal of weapons, tailormade
for massive area denial. The Goliath's main gun is almost certainly
capable of engaging spacecraft.
Four massive boosters keep the Goliath mobile. This locomotion system makes the Goliath
surprisingly agile, but it is also a weakness. Targeting the boosters should allow a quick mobility kill,
rendering the Goliath vulnerable to followup
attack.
Most Goliath weapons deal Solar damage.

Card: Bracus Tho'ourg , Points: 10
Victory comes on the wings of death.
Reports of the one they call Bracus Tho'ourg began in the earliest days of contact with the Cabal. The
first Guardians who faced him are long lost, but the legends speak of a powerful commander who
secured the Buried City with merely a fraction of the Cabal's forces on Mars. If these reports are
accurate, they provide clues not only to Tho'ourg's tactical prowess but to the Cabal lifespan.
Card: Bracus Tha'aurn , Points: 15
Embrace suffering. Only then can it be conquered.
Bracus Tha'aurn appears remarkable among Cabal commanders for his interest in the glories of our
Golden Age. Having been faced only in the company of Psions, the Vanguard has reason to believe
he maintains some sort of command over their deployment.
Card: Primus Sha'aull , Points: 15
If your enemy speaks with a blade, master the sword.
No one knows what fascination the Vex hold for the leader of the Blind Legion, but Primus Sha'aull
has put his command at great risk by pushing into lands occupied by the machines.
Card: The Psion Flayers , Points: 15
"We have just as much to learn from our enemies as we do from our past."
Somewhere among their forces, the Cabal hide one of their most powerful weapons, the Psion
Flayers. The extent of their ability is still uncharted, but Cryptarch studies and Warlock fears have led
the Vanguard to classify them as a serious threat.
Many among the Warlock orders believe the Flayers pulled Phobos from its natural orbit, holding it in
place, waiting for the order to release as a weapon.
Card: Valus Ta'aurc , Points: 15
"The last sounds to reach their ears were the creak of tank tread and the battlecry
of Ta'aurc."
From his armored seat of power, Valus Ta'aurc has claimed more ground on Mars than any known
Cabal commander. His name is feared throughout Meridian Bay, and the treadmarks
left by his tank
have come to signify the expansion of the Cabal's everwidening
Exclusion Zone.

Card: The Darkness , Points: 5
Something hit us. Killed our Golden Age. Nearly wiped us out. Only the Traveler saved us, and at a
shattering cost.
The Speaker tells of a cosmic force that swept over us and caused the Collapse. Legend calls it the
Darkness, the Traveler's ancient enemy, which hunted it across space.
All we have left are questions. Centuries of debate gave birth to competing arguments on the nature
of the Darkness and the Collapse.
The Pujari Position describes the Darkness as a force with both physical and moral presence, an
actualization of evil. Pujari art depicts the Darkness as a great storm, or as a change in conduct, a
corruption that emerged from within and poisoned the Golden Age.
Saint14'
s Position argues that the Darkness was an invading armada, an alien force of incredible but
tangible power.
Some adherents believe that this armada sprang from species rejected or
discarded by the Traveler for their sins.
UlanTan's
Thesis considers the Darkness a necessary symmetry to the Traveler in a cosmic
balance. In this view, the Traveler's goodness led it to sacrifice for others, and it is up to us to return
this goodness by healing the Traveler.
The Monist Position, or the Deflationary Position, considers the Darkness as a technologically
sophisticated force, perhaps a postSingularity
intelligence. Adherents invoke information theory or
contend that the universe is a simulation, allowing advanced intelligence to gain weakly acausal
powers by bending the rules.
The Acataleptic Clause claims that we are intrinsically unable to understand the Darkness. In many
respects this belief parallels the Praxic Creed, which suggests that we should stop worrying about the
nature of the Darkness and focus on resisting and defeating it.
Certain positions often
labeled heretical imply
that the Traveler itself triggered the Collapse, or that
it knew the Darkness was coming for it and hoped to use the Solar System as a sacrifice or a proxy
army. The Binary Star cult is one notable example.

Dreams of Alpha Lupi
The universe is a beast.
The body is made from tiny stuff, from nearnothings.
From atoms swimming through a blood of
crackling sparks. Simple, eternal Laws shape the beast. The largest galaxy is ruled by principles of
mass and motion. Electrons are slaves to charge and to chance. And this is why the universe feels
inexhaustible, eternal.
No sun complains about its death. Life is the problem. Life can be woven from flesh or circuit or
thoughtful light. Origins don't matter. But small, halfsmart
creatures have a fierce talent for denying
the inevitable, for balking and complaining about injustices that don't exist and consequences that
should be borne in silence.
Card: Ghost Fragment: Darkness 3 , Points: 10
From the Journals of Toland, the Shattered
I drive myself to the edge of madness trying to explain the truth.
It's so simple. Elegant like a knife point. It explains this
is not hyperbole, this is the farthest thing
from exaggeration EVERYTHING.
But you lay it out and they stare at you like you've just been exhaling dust. Maybe they're missing
some underlying scaffold of truth. Maybe they are all propped on a bed of lies that must be burned
away.
Why does anything exist?
No no no no no don't reach for that word. There's no 'reason'. That's teleology and teleology will stitch
your eyelids shut.
Why do we have atoms? Because atomic matter is more stable than the primordial broth. Atoms
defeated the broth. That was the first war. There were two ways to be and one of them won. And
everything that came next was made of atoms.
Atoms made stars. Stars made galaxies. Worlds simmered down to rock and acid and in those
smoking primal seas the first living molecule learned to copy itself. All of this happened by the one
law, the blind law, which exists without mind or meaning. It's the simplest law but it has no
worshippers here (out there, though, out there !)
HOW DO I EXPLAIN IT it's so simple WHY DON'T YOU SEE
Imagine three great nations under three great queens. The first queen writes a great book of law and
her rule is just. The second queen builds a high tower and her people climb it to see the stars. The
third queen raises an army and conquers everything.
The future belongs to one of these queens. Her rule is harshest and her people are unhappy. But she
rules.
This explains everything, understand? This is why the universe is the way it is, and not some other
way. Existence is a game that everything plays, and some strategies are winners: the ability to exist,
to shape existence, to remake it so that your descendants molecules
or stars or people or ideas will
flourish, and others will find no ground to grow.
And as the universe ticks on towards the close, the great players will face each other. In the next
round there will be three queens and all of them will have armies, and now it will be a battle of swords
until
one discovers the cannon, or the plague, or the killing word.
Everything is becoming more ruthless and in the end only the most ruthless will remain (LOOK UP AT
THE SKY) and they will hunt the territories of the night and extinguish the first glint of competition
before it can even understand what it faces or why it has transgressed. This is the shape of victory: to
rule the universe so absolutely that nothing will ever exist except by your consent. This is the queen
at the end of time, whose sovereignty is eternal because no other sovereign can defeat it. And there
is no reason for it, no more than there was reason for the victory of the atom. It is simply the winning
play.
Of course, it might be that there was another country, with other queens, and in this country they sat
down together and made one law and one tower and one army to guard their borders. This is the
dream of small minds: a gentle place ringed in spears.
But I do not think those spears will hold against the queen of the country of armies. And that is all that
will matter in the end.
Card: Ghost Fragment: Darkness 4 , Points: 15
This war is all there is for you.
What else do you have? You walk among mortals and immortals, a creature lost in time. Your only
purpose is the struggle.
Does it seem unfair? To be brought back into this, the end of days, the long dwindling exhalation of
an ancient corpse? You were at peace. Now you are a dead husk charged with war. Do you
remember anything of freedom?
Fight on, then. The war IS everything.
But consider the choices before you.

Dreams of Alpha Lupi
You see history hidden between the barren rocks and within the high acid clouds. You see the ruin
ready to claim its birthright.
Sunlight starves. The fierceness chills and thins and runs sweet. A new ocean emerges, thick and
salty and hot, from springs and geysers that drench the dead ground.
You wonder: will this world's second birth be its finest?
Card: Ishtar Sink , Points: 5
The Ishtar Sink region looms large in our surviving knowledge of Venus. Guardians come hunting the
ruins of the legendary Ishtar Collective, a sprawling Golden Age scientific project. But the ancient
ruins that brought the Collective to the Sink have awakened again.
We aren't the only ones interested in the Collective. The Fallen House of Winter has hurled its assets
into pillaging the ruins, hunting for some advantage whether
from the Golden Age, or forgotten times
beyond. The House of Winter's presence includes constant Skiff overflights in support of ground
teams and hints of an improvised command post or staging area in the volcanic Cinders.
The situation is degrading into a race against time. We must claim the Collective's ruins for our own and
hope they will warn us what other threats now rise from Venus' acid seas and ancient stone.

The box appears to be copper.
The red lid is dented, one hinge shattered.
Inside waits a small quantity of the finest, driest powder, more brown than gray, more blue than
green.
The greatest minds in creation make quick work of the material. The powder is weighed by the grain,
and studied close, and remembered. One hundred billion bits of nearnothing
reside inside the copper
box, all of them tiny and nearly spherical, all etched with the outlines of continents and islands and
icecaps. Each sphere represents a planet, and some of these tiny globes match known worlds.
There is one Earth and one Mars and a Venus too.
The box holds renderings of every habitable world in the galaxy.
One of them offers a simple explanation:
"The box is a message. The message is the minuscule nature of the box's cargo. It's the image of one
hundred billion worlds barely filling two hands."
But if so, who is delivering this message? What vastness do they wish to impress on us? Is it a
warning, or an invitation, or a taunt?

"From across the ruined earth they came, seeking shelter from the storm."
Every wayward soul unlucky enough to be born outside The City's protecting arms whispers its truth
across the wastes: a metropolis, risen from the ashes of the Collapse, sheltered by the Traveler. It is
a promise and a dream, the only refuge from the Darkness.
The City is a thriving walled ecumene, rich with the languages and traditions of every surviving human
and neohuman culture. The City's population faces real challenges: inequality, fear, scarcity, and the
specter of internal strife. But the great traditions of the Golden Age live on, and many classes of
suffering and injustice have been eradicated forever.

"Beneath crossed swords, a refuge for peace."
The Tower is the only home many Guardians ever know.
To the people of the City, it stands as a promise that we can endure. The merchants and citizens who

venture into the Darkness beyond.
Card: The Golden Age , Points: 0
The Traveler changed everything. It reshaped our solar system as decisively as it shattered our
scientific and philosophical frameworks. To our ancestors it must have been a hammerblow a
glimpse beyond the horizon of expected possibility and into a realm of transcendent power.
The Traveler kindled the Golden Age. But we built it. We remember this with pride, even after so
much else has been lost. We settled our solar system and filled it with our work.
Today Cryptarchs and scholars work to distill the legends of the Golden Age into truth. We know that
humans lived longer, flew further, and knew more. We know that countless ancient diseases and
hatreds were extinguished forever. Human aspiration gives birth to vast engineering projects,
sweeping social movements, and even new forms of life.
The Golden Age was not without challenges. Sources speak of internal strife, philosophical riftsparticularly
around questions of machine intelligence and 'mind forking' and
enduring scientific
enigmas. But humanity and its machine children tackled these problems with pride, vigor, and a
contagious sense of pluralist compassion.

"What are you thinking about?" I asked.
"When I was a little boy," Father said.
"During the Before," I said.
"Yes."
He reached down to brush my hair. "I was recalling how very smart I used to be. When I was your
age, I was a genius."
"You're smart now," I said.
He laughed hard.
"Look around," he said.
I always look around.
"Miss nothing," he told me.
Father was standing beside a big gray building.
"This is what I want you to see," he said.
The building had no doors or windows.
"Do you know how to make a strong password?" he asked.
"I don't know if I do," I said.
"Tell yourself a story," he said. "Use that one good story you'll never forget, that you can carry forever.
Let your story take odd turns and wear a few surprising marks, make sure it belongs to you, so you
can keep it secret."
Father kneeled, putting our faces close...
"I want to show you something special," he said. "Something rare."
I tried to imagine what that might be.
"No," he warned. "You can't guess."
Inside the gray building was a diamond wall...A projected sky floated above us. It wasn't our sky, alive
with metal and light. Nothing about the grayness was wet and nothing looked alive. I had never seen
a sadder piece of ground.
"This was our world," Father said. "When I was your age."
I touched the diamond wall. He watched my hand jump back.
"Hot," I said.
He laughed quietly.
I shook my burnt hand, and it felt better.
"Our world was this. The entire planet was a furnace. Acidic. Dead in so many ways. And I was your
age."
I was bored with the dead world. I looked at Father's face, asking, "Can we leave?"
He started to reach for my hair again but decided not to.
I was bored with everything.
"When I was your age, people thought they knew almost everything. We had scientific laws and
human truths, even a model of the universe. People carried pictures of the past and tried to have a
clear vision of their difficult future. I didn't know everything, of course. But when I was a boy, I had
every expectation of living a smart short life and learning quite a lot more.
"Then the Before was finished.
"You know why.
"That's when everybody, particularly the smartest of us, learned that we knew nothing. We were
children and our little ideas were toys, and the universe was cut apart with great ideas and
magnificent, immeasurable potentials."
Father stopped talking.
I stepped away from the hot diamond wall.
"Do you know what I wanted to show you?" Father asked.
"Dead rock," I said.
"Guess again." He wasn't happy with me.
We stepped back into the real sun, the real world. I blinked and looked around, surprised by how
green and bright everything was. How happy everything was. Even the saddest face was happy.
"I know what you want me to see," I said.
"Don't tell me," he said.
I didn't tell him.

They came from the wild lands, gathering in secret enclaves, slipping through the howling ruins of

From the deep black came the Awoken, their eyes haunted. Exos marched in the refugee columns,
cloaked in moss and shattered memories. And among them came the Ghosts, beginning their search.
It was a time of vast suffering and terrible evil. But there was one hope: the promise of a refuge

Loken's men found Jaren Ward in the courtyard where this had all began.
Nine guns trained on him. Nine cold hearts awaiting the order. Magistrate Loken, standing behind
them, looked pleased with himself.
Jaren Ward stood in silence. His Ghost peeked out over his shoulder.
Loken took in the crowd before stepping forward, as if to claim the ground his
ground. "You question
me?" There was venom in his words. "This is not your home."
I remember Loken's gestures here. Making a show of it all.
Everyone else was still. Quiet.
I tugged at my father's sleeve, but he just tightened his grip on my shoulder to the point pain. His way
of letting me know that this was not the time.
I'd watched Jaren's every move over the past months, mapping his effortless gestures and slight,
earned mannerisms. I'd never seen anything like him. He was something I couldn't comprehend, and
yet I felt I understood all I needed the moment I'd seen him. He was more than us. Not better. Not
superior. Just more.
I wanted father to stop what was happening. Looking back now, I realize that he didn't want to stop it.
No one d id.
As Loken belittled Jaren Ward, taunted him, enumerated his crimes and sins, my eyes were stuck on
Jaren's pistol, fixed to his hip. His steady hand resting calmly on his belt.
I remembered the pistol's weight. Effortless. And my concern faded. I understood.
"This is our town! My town!" Loken was shouting now. He was going to make a show of Jaren teach
the people of Palamon a lesson in obedience.
Jaren spoke: clear, calm. "Not anymore."
Loken laughed dismissively. He had nine guns on his side. "Those gonna be your last words then,
boy?"
The movement was a flash: quick as chain lightning. Jaren Ward spoke as he moved. "Yours. Not
mine."
Smoke trailed from Jaren's revolver.
Loken hit the ground. A dark hole in his forehead. Eyes staring into eternity.
Jaren stared down the nine guns trained on him. One by one, they lowered their aim. And the rest of
my life began where,
in a few short years, so many others would be ended.

When did the City Age begin? Perhaps when the bulk of the world's survivors lived beneath the
Traveler, rather than in the wilderness. Or when the Titans raised the first wall. Or at Six Fronts, when
the City first faced coordinated, overwhelming attack and
repelled it decisively.
The City did not rise without struggle. Warlords and wilderness fiefdoms clung to power. Starvation,
disease, and anarchy menaced. But the Guardians held the frontier, and the children of the Golden
Age kept the fire burning through the long climb back.
Legends walk through this history. The Iron Lords. Saint14'
s crusade against the Fallen. The mask of
the Speaker. The great Ahamkara Hunt. Toland's madness. Terrible Faction Wars and
the
horrifying, disastrous effort to retake the Moon.
As the City learned to walk again, it found a world overrun by alien menace. It faced disaster and
defeat. Even in recent years, as Guardians begin to venture back to the Moon and the inner planets,
the City's territory has withdrawn outer
sections abandoned and converted into fortifications in the
wake of the Battle of Twilight Gap.
But the City's shipwrights and foundries hum with energy. The probability kilns and work cooperatives
produce new wonders. The Darkness is rising again. But so is the Light.

"We once looked to the Moon and saw hope. Now we see only the power of the Darkness."
Earth's Moon was where we first faced the terror of the Hive, and it soon became the battlefield of a
great war one
we did not win. In the years since, the Hive have ripped the Moon's surface apart,
opening chasms that swarm with terrors.

The support base centered here marks what most believe was the first offEarth

It was here that we came facetoface
with Crota and his legions, a force so powerful we abandoned

BY ORDER OF THE CITY CONSENSUS AND THE GUARDIAN VANGUARD
ALL SHIPS IMMEDIATE/REPEAT AND RELAY
We hereby terminate all organized combat operations on or around Earth's Moon.
Effective immediately we declare the existence of an interdiction on the Moon and cisLunar
space.
Guardians operating in this interdict will receive no formal support from the Vanguard or from assets
of the City. We urge Guardians to exhibit the greatest care and consideration in approaching the
interdicted space.
We furthermore derogate all strategic objectives concerned with the recovery of assets or information
from the Lunar surface, and, without exemption, cancel in whole and in all its parts the effort to
establish a beachhead and strategic presence upon the Moon.
This interdict will remain in effect until such time as the hostile presence on the Moon poses a
demonstrable existential threat, or until intelligence is obtained that leads to the defeat of the enemy
leadership elements recently encountered.
Guardians with an accurate assessment of losses in the recent days, or with intelligence on the
nature and method of hostile resistance, should report to the Vanguard immediately for debriefing.

In the years since the Collapse, much of Mars has returned to the desolation that came before the

Dreams of Alpha Lupi
Life waits inside this world's bones.
Your voice flows across the red rock and through the dead valleys, speaking in code and goads.
Ancient volcanoes swell, exploding at their peaks and splitting wide along their shoulders. Ash clouds
blacken the starved air. A fossil ocean of ice softens and collapses. Geysers erupt, tall as mountains,
throwing up steam and clouds.
Every moment matters. And from a great distance, in the midst of a thousand careful disasters, you
watch the transformation with your own eyes.
The rose has blossomed.

"A great city is a place where man competes with the Gods."
Under the shifting sands of Meridian Bay are the ruins of the magnificent Freehold, a testament to the

We want your grandchildren.
Does that sound grim? Don't panic. We aren't talking about human babies, yours or anyone else's.
We're talking about your inventions. The children of your mind.
Come join us. Come to Clovis Bray and build the laboratory of your dreams. Anything you need.
Demand it and it's yours. At Clovis Bray, we have a singular understanding of genius, and we
appreciate how brilliant minds flourish when they enjoy total freedom.
This is Freehold, the realm where the new and the best is born. This is where your brilliance, freed of
budget constraints and managers, makes the universe dance.
Clovis Bray is a nursery, a nursery to a million marvels. Your inventions belong to no one but you.
Cherish them, praise them. Or tell them they aren't worthy and set them inside a deep dark drawer.
But as every parent soon learns, children grow up. And every technology matures. At some point,
your inventions are going to find mates. They'll join with other marvels and produce a new generation
of offspring.
Maybe you'll build a better reactor.
Meanwhile, the genius in the lab next door devises an elegant way to fold machines into tiny spaces.
Your device meets hers, and a fierce little reactor is born.
Your children are yours forever. And we are happy to arrange for their grandchildren to prosper.

"The Belt is the key to everything."
The Asteroid Belt is a great band of nothingness, speckled with unimaginable wealth. Once a treasure
trove for Golden Age industry, the Belt is now a haunted place where Fallen pirates and Awoken
patrols skirmish among the whispering carcasses of ancient machines.
Among the asteroids drifts the Reef, lashed together from the ruined ships of an ancient exodus. Here
the Queen rules over the Awoken the
farthest known light of civilization.

Even the largest body lets itself be pushed where it needs to be, seduced into nice, warm loving

Out beyond the Reef its rings shine. Whatever was known of it in the Golden Age is long forgotten,
but more ancient truth remains: Saturn has dozens of moons, including the mighty Titan, a world
larger than Mercury.
A Guardian's ship might, in theory, reach Saturn, especially if supported by a larger vessel and good
navigational data. But the hazards of the Reef and the Deep Black beyond threaten to devour anyone
who makes the attempt.

A cold giant shows its night face to you. Distant moons slide past icy
little comets enslaved by a

You put yourself on the perfect trajectory, and for a fraction of an instant you allow yourself the luxury

What will your legend say?
Card: A Guardian Rises , Points: 5
And so you rise again. Who you were before or how you ended up at the wall of an Old Russian

gifted with the power to wield its Light in the coming battles of a timeless war. Trust this Ghost. It will
guide you on your path.
Card: Restoration , Points: 5
"Taking down an Archon is no easy task. With the master of the Fallen servitors gone, the House of

Card: Vault of Glass , Points: 5
His name was Kabr. He wasn't my friend but I knew and respected him as a Guardian and a good
man.
He fought the Vex alone. This destroyed him. In the time before he vanished he said things that I
think should be remembered. These are some of them:
"In the Vault time frays and a needle moves through it. The needle is the will of Atheon. I do not know
the name of the shape that comes after the needle.
No one can open the Vault alone. I opened the Vault. There was no one with me but I was not alone.
You will meet the Templar in a place that is a time before or after stars. The stars will move around
you and mark you and sing to you. They will decide if you are real.
I drank of them. It tasted like the sea."
That is all I can remember.
Pahanin
Card: Relic: The Aegis , Points: 5
These are the last words of Kabr, the Legionless:
I have destroyed myself to do this. They have taken my Ghost. They are in my blood and brain. But
now there is hope.
I have made a wound in the Vault. I have pierced it and let in the Light. Bathe in it, and be cleansed.
Look to it, and understand:
From my own Light and from the thinking flesh of the Vex I made a shield. The shield is your
deliverance. It will break the unbreakable. It will change your fate.
Bind yourself to the shield. Bind yourself to me. And if you abandon your purpose, let the Vault
consume you, as it consumed me.
Now it is done. If I speak again, I am not Kabr.

Card: Crucible Introduction , Points: 0
"You wanna live? You're gonna have to prove it."
The Crucible is a series of grueling challenges that pit Guardians against one another in open
combat. Crucible combat is livefire,
with Ghosts standing by to save the dead.
Whether alone or with a Fireteam, Guardians enter the Crucible to hone vital survival skills, build their
own reputations, and win the patronage of City factions. Most importantly, the Crucible allows
Guardians to train against formidable adversaries without fear of disaster.
Card: Control , Points: 5
"Capture and defend, Guardians!"
6v6. Fight for control of strategic battle zones. Hold your ground to gain the momentum.
Seize control of key locations. The more zones you hold, the more points each kill will be worth.
Card: Clash , Points: 5
"Engage and execute all targets!"
6v6. Form an alliance and fight for supremacy across the ruins of our old worlds.
Pure combat. Two teams. Engage and eliminate your enemy utilizing teamwork and skill. In victory or
defeat, all Guardians who brave the Crucible will be better prepared for the dangers beyond the City.
Card: Rumble , Points: 5
"Watch your back, Guardian. No one else will."
You against all. Hone your Light by challenging your fellow Guardians in a fight for survival.
Rumble is a freeforall
fight for dominance. You have no friends here. There will be no mercy.
Challenge the strong and prey on the weak.
Card: Skirmish , Points: 5
"Stick together, team!"
3v3. A focused engagement between two fireteams. Teamwork is your greatest weapon.
Small scale tactical combat. Revive teammates to get them back in the fight, but be wary: you might
just be feeding the enemy kills.
Card: Salvage , Points: 5
"Secure the relics! But expect heavy resistance."
3v3. Secure and defend the Relics to claim the secrets of our past.
Golden Age mysteries litter our old worlds. Scour the battlefield for the relics, lock them down, and
keep the other team from contesting your claim.
Card: Combined Arms , Points: 5
"Honor is earned, not given. So earn it."
6v6. Coordinate vehicles and your ground game to control the battlefield and rout your opponents.
This is war. Guardians face off in largescale

"Only the brave and the strong are worthy of this test."
On occasion, the Crucible will call upon those Guardians who have proven themselves to face

Card: The Burning Shrine , Points: 5
"They do not simply invade new worlds, they infect them remaking
them in their image, until
only Vex remain."
ARENA DESIGNATION: The Burning Shrine
LOCATION: Fields of Glass, Mercury
This clockwork impossibility is but one small conduit in a vast network, extending throughout the dead
planet's core.
The unknown energies and complex mechanics of the Shrine have been studied and mapped by the
curious, yet its purpose remains a mystery. The only truth that can be agreed upon is that the
structure is intimately tied to the past, and future, of one of our greatest enemies the
Vex.
The Shrine has been claimed as a battleground for the Crucible in an effort to familiarize Guardians
with both Vex architecture and the otherworldly energies that signal their presence. Having a constant
flow of combatready
Guardians on hand should the Shrine ever achieve a higher functionality is
simply a strategic byproduct of the Crucible's presence.
Card: Shores of Time , Points: 5
"All power is humbled when weighed against the eternal tide."
ARENA DESIGNATION: Shores of Time
LOCATION: Maat Mons, Venus
The sulfur caves along the Shores of Time are now too unstable to be an effective base of operations
for the Vex, but they suit the purposes of the Crucible just fine.
The region, which also houses the remains of one of the Ishtar Collective's many research stations, is
a mix of geological chaos and the structured intent of ancient Vex machinery. The contrast between
jagged, boiling terrain and the measured purpose of each Vex surface creates a unique battlefield one
where the planet itself seems to have risen up in defiance of the Vex intrusion.
Card: Asylum , Points: 5
"There used to be life here. Now it's just overgrowth."
ARENA DESIGNATION: Asylum
LOCATION: Ishtar Sink, Venus
Before the Collapse, this would've been just another stop on the subway line between Clovis Bray's
Venus arcology headquarters and the Academy campus by the shore. Now, it's a grim reminder of the
lives, the dreams, and the progress we lost when the Darkness came. For the Guardians of the
Crucible, it's a place to sharpen their blades in the shadow of the Vex, an enemy who knows no such
sentimentality.
Card: Twilight Gap , Points: 5
"Here we fight, for the memory of those who stood. Here we die, for the glory of the Light that
never fades."
ARENA DESIGNATION: Twilight Gap
LOCATION: City Perimeter, Earth
Named for the City's greatest battle, this defensive battery once held the front line against the
combined might of the Fallen Houses. Overrun during the course of the invasion, many Guardians
lost their lives to hold the line.
That the Crucible now claims this hallowed ground is seen as a privilege a
rite of passage, as new
generations of Guardians stand and fight where the brave fell, heroes rose, and legends were born.
Card: The Rusted Lands , Points: 5
"The scars of our collapse mark the land. Reminders that all is fragile in the face of time."
ARENA DESIGNATION: The Rusted Lands
LOCATION: Eastern Flood Zone, Earth
"The Hive never leaves the Moon." This is dogma a
way to soothe frightened children and reassure
wary Guardians.
Not so long ago, a wandering Hunter and her Fireteam stumbled onto a feral community in the
Eastern Flood Zone. The gaunt survivors huddled in these bombedout
ruins spoke of a terrible
presence and begged for protection. No selfrespecting
Guardian could refuse.
As night fell, the Guardians found themselves the hunted stalked
through the ruins by shapes of
bone and shadow. The discovery of a Hive Seeder made the truth plain. Mankind's ancient enemy
had come to Earth.
The final confrontation came in the shadow of the Seeder, as a Hive Wizard and her Knights rose to
challenge the Guardians. Only one Guardian returned to the City, her knife painted in black ash, a
trail of grateful survivors in tow.
Now, in the chilling shadows of the Hive's pods, Guardians hone their skills in hopes that they may
one day live up to the heroes of the Rusted Lands.
Card: Exodus Blue , Points: 0
"In the shadows of all that we were, we fight for all we can be."
ARENA DESIGNATION: Exodus Blue
LOCATION: Cosmodrome, Earth
Grimly referred to as "The Graveyard," Exodus Blue was only recently secured for Crucible combat.
Located among the ruins of one of the Cosmodrome's colony ship gantries, this site is a memorial to
the grief and horror of the Collapse. Thousands died here in a lastditch
effort to outrun the oncoming
Darkness.
But it is also a sign of hope. Once the Cosmodrome is secure, the great colony ships may fly again.
And this location was chosen specifically to send a message to the Fallen House of Devils "
You may
be picking at the bones of our history, but we are still here, and we are still strong."
Card: The Anomaly , Points: 5
"Our greatest enemy is the unknown."
ARENA DESIGNATION: Anomaly
LOCATION: Mare Cognitum, Earth's Moon
Documents recovered onsite
listed this research station only as "K1", although the location was hard
to keep secret, given the intense electromagnetic fluctuations emanating from what City scholars
have come to know as the Anomaly. Attempts to scan the Anomaly itself have proven futile, as the
casing is constructed in a manner that defies modern techniques.
Reports suggest that those who spent time in proximity to the Anomaly reported symptoms of
insomnia, some so severe they required hospitalization. It was the City's recommendation that only
remote sensing equipment be used until such time that a full review of the existing data could be
completed.
In the meantime, stewardship of the facility was handed over to the Guardians in order to maintain a
watch against the Hive forces that will inevitably come in search of this mysterious power.
Card: First Light , Points: 5
"The Earth shines so bright from here."
ARENA DESIGNATION: First Light
LOCATION: Mare Cognitum, Earth's Moon
What was once an unassuming exobotany laboratory complex turned into ringside seats to the end of
the world during the Collapse. Immense fissures in the Moon's crust spew a sickly yellow miasma,
and hint at the utter destruction going on deep beneath the surface. Whatever the Hive are up to,
they've been at it a long time, and they're not overly concerned with keeping Luna in one piece.
Card: Firebase Delphi , Points: 5
"It's empty for now like
a ghost town. But for how long...and why?"
ARENA DESIGNATION: Firebase Delphi
LOCATION: Eos Chasma, Mars
When the Cabal decide to hold an area, they dig in deep. It's surprising, then, that the tunnel system
at Firebase Delphi is woefully incomplete by Sand Eater standards. One theory is that it was built
simply to be inspected, to satisfy some commander's lack of progress on another front. Perhaps the
Cabal simply cut their losses once they realized that the location of the base was suboptimal,
although halfmeasures
are really not something they're known for. We're talking about a culture that
will grind a mountain to dust rather than build around it.
Card: Bastion , Points: 5
"There's no telling the scale of devastation hidden beneath these red sands."
ARENA DESIGNATION: Bastion
LOCATION: Meridian Bay, Mars
Thick, rugged terrain masks one of the largest Vex structures on Mars, leaving this imposing gate as
the only conventional entrance. With the Cabal's interest in Vex activity, it was a matter of when, not
if, they would set their sights here.
The Cabal deployed a massive ground and air offensive to breach the wall and enter the
subterranean labyrinth. We don't know what the Vex deployed in defense, but we know this: the
Cabal didn't make it very far.
The Vex have since mysteriously vanished from this region, giving the Crucible one of its largest
arenas in the solar system. The Cabal, on the other hand, still prefer to keep their distance.
Card: Blind Watch , Points: 5
"Dry as the bones you'll break."
ARENA DESIGNATION: The Blind Watch
LOCATION: Meridian Bay, Mars
The Blind Watch was once a clandestine Guardian outpost on the outskirts of Freehold, used to
monitor Cabal activity in and around the Buried City. After the Cabal consolidated their forces nearer
their fortified Exclusion Zone, the site was reclaimed by the Crucible as a combat training ground.
Resting atop an old Clovis Bray science facility, the Blind Watch allows Guardians to acclimate to the
harsh Martian environment, while maintaining a combat ready presence should the Cabal ever begin
to mobilize.

"These are our worlds...Take them back. Inch by inch. Bullet by bullet."
Some Guardians roam the wastelands in search of adventure. For decades they have placed
beacons across the frontier, so that our allies in the Tower can transmit requests to those out in the
wilds.
There are ancient mysteries buried in the ruins, great treasures of our Golden Age to seek. There are
fearsome enemies to be slaughtered, their secrets and technology to be brought home and studied.
Only Guardians can push through the Darkness to reach these contested areas, and this makes their
particular expertise very valuable to those bound by the City's walls.
Card: Public Events Introduction , Points: 0
"Trust me. You can't do this alone."
Our enemies never rest. If the City is to reclaim its lost worlds, Guardians must band together to stop
our foes from completing their objectives.
The City trusts its Guardians to assess the situation whether
a Fallen extraction crew, a Cabal
demolition team, a Hive ritual, a mysterious Vex behavior, or something stranger yet and
engage or
retreat as you see fit. Every battle won is another victory against the Darkness. But our foes will send
their strongest, and they may be too much to overcome alone.
Guardians who band together will survive to tell stories of their triumph. Watch the skies. When the
enemy moves, look to the Guardians beside you, comrades and strangers alike.
