<p> On the sixtieth day of vomiting, St. Harold commanded that those followers closest to Plutonius shall not engage the heathens of the land. For those so close to achieving an understanding of the fire &quot;One Cannot See&quot; must remain pure of energy absorbing poisons.

Prayer will replace clenched fists, with Heavenly Belief as your shield.

Until the &quot;Great Hydro-Mechanical Reckoning,&quot; you will abide by this. Until your pagan brothers return to their home ready for the Final Battle.

So it is written. So shall it be done.

St. Harold of the Leafy Scalp </p>
