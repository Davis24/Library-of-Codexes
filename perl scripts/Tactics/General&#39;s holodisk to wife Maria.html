<p> Although it pains me to record this, I must continue. Time is short and my future is less than certain. *deep breath* I am currently captured and held prisoner by a large group of super mutants and I don&#39;t believe that I&#39;m going to make it back this time.

But, once again, time is short and I&#39;ll use it to tell you what&#39;s important.

I love you Maria. I&#39;ve loved you since we first met and I love you even more fifty years since.

We were always much alike, you and I. And know that I would never have had the courage to fight for humanity without you faithfully by my side.

For, in the end, I realize I did it all for you. For I wanted nothing more but to restore order to this chaotic world so you can live a life free of danger, free of fear and free of ungodly mutations.

I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m out of time.

I will make every attempt to fix this world for you, my love. I promise.

Love Eternal,

Simon Barnaky </p>
