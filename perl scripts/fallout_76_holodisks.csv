Once, in the world before the war, this would have been a joyous time to celebrate with loved ones. Now it's a time to reflect and to mourn. It was on this day ten years ago that we lost so much in the tragic event we call the Christmas Flood. I'm making this recording in the hopes of ensuring the flood and its victims are never forgotten.\n\n\n\nI suppose the story really begins in November of 2077, the month after the war. Survivors from the Pleasant Valley Ski Resort sent a group to Charleston to ask for help and supplies. The city leaders turned them away. There was so much chaos and so much need back then, I suppose it was an impossible request to grant.\n\n\n\nThe failure to secure help led to a change in leadership for the survivors at the ski resort. A cold and brutal man named David Thorpe took charge, and he shaped those people into something terrible. They took what they wanted by force and killed anyone that stood in their way.\n\n\n\nYears later, Thorpe's girlfriend Rosalynn led a raid on Charleston. They were spotted early, and a fight broke out. A few of them escaped, but Rosalynn was injured and taken prisoner along with some of the other raiders.\n\n\n\nBy then, the Responders were more or less running things in the city, and we were doing pretty well for ourselves. We felt confident we could confront the raiders on their home turf, so we sent a group up into the mountains to see if we could make a deal. We hoped we could get them to leave us alone if we agreed to release some of the prisoners. We were wrong. Thorpe had somehow got his hands on a mini-nuke, and he used it to blow the Summersville Dam on Christmas morning.\n\n\n\nWe lost almost everything; our homes, our supplies and most of our friends and family. The days and weeks that followed were the hardest of my life, but somehow, we held together. We kept the idea of the Responders alive, even though there were only a handful of us left. That's the story of the Christmas Flood. Tell your children, tell everyone you meet. Let's keep the memory alive for as long as we can.""}]"

Supply shortages had driven the price of medicine beyond what we could afford. Lucky for us, my mom wasn't just a nurse, but also a natural green thumb. We had a garden with all kinds of herbs and flowers. She treated me with home-made herbal remedies.\n\n\n\nToday, disease is rampant. There are countless viruses and bacterial infections out there, and we need a way to deal with them. I was hoping I might find something here to help treat all the sick and injured refugees we've got back at the airport. Unfortunately, the place has been picked pretty clean by now, and there isn't much left.\n\n\n\nSo, having had basically no luck in this creepy abandoned hospital, I've decided to turn instead to my mother's wisdom.

I've instructed Ella to give you this holotape on the event of my death. Please don't blame anything you're about to hear on her. These are my wishes. Ella has respected them, and I expect you to as well.\n\n\n\nI've been diagnosed with Parkinson's. I've still got plenty of time to live a normal life... well as normal as can be expected... But the time will come where my health will deteriorate and I can no longer care for myself. I love you both tremendously, and you know that... but I will not be a burden to you, my children. Especially in these dark times. If everything has gone according to plan, hopefully my death has meant something.\n\n\n\nPlease understand why I chose not to tell you. Abbie, you are smart enough to see our work through till the end. Calvin, you're turning into such a fine young man. Your mother would've been proud, but not as proud as me. You two take care of each other. You're going to make it through this. I know it.""}]"

Yes, its time for more thrilling TALES FROM THE WEST VIRGINIA HILLS!\n\n\n\nNot all creatures are of the land, some stalk the skies. One such bogeyman has been reported for generations by mystified West Virginians. Its name remains the same, but accounts and speculations about its nature very wildly.

She found me trying to break into a Nuka-Cola machine and showed me a different way. So Kesha... can you tell us a bit about how we can make sure our water is safe for drinking? Try to keep it to the basics for training purposes.\n\n\n\nKesha McDermott: It's not complicated, really. Find water and strain out any big particles and chunks. Then boil it in a pot over an open fire for a minute or two, then let it cool. Should be fine. Like making tea, right?\n\n\n\nDassa Ben-Ami: You joined the Responders a while ago and helped develop a program to train volunteers. So, were you a survivalist prior to all of this?\n\n\n\nKesha McDermott: You could say that. I taught high school kids! I used to talk about this very thing to them - practical application of the sciences. It's fascinating, but... you never realize how important some things will be down the road, do you?\n\n\n\nDassa Ben-Ami: I guess not. So, if we were students of yours, what would you tell us about the world now? How can we survive?\n\n\n\nKesha McDermott: That's a good question, Dassa. I would tell you all first of all, to remain calm and focus on surviving. The first thing you need to do is get yourself some clean drinking water. It's likely all you'll find is dirty water, but that's ok! We can fix it. Dirty water carries a small chance of disease and is a bit radioactive. You'll probably survive if you drink it, but you shouldn't take that risk. It's better than toxic water or nuclear waste though, which are both very harmful and should be boiled thoroughly first. Got that, Dassa?\n\n\n\nDassa Ben-Ami: Yes'm - contaminated waters should be boiled. Ok. That sounds easy enough. So boiled water is safe?\n\n\n\nKesha McDermott: It's mostly safe, but still a bit radioactive. What you really want is purified water.\n\n\n\nDassa Ben-Ami: Ohh, purified water. How do I get that?\n\n\n\nKesha McDermott: You can build machines that will do it for you, and that's the most reliable way. Building them requires some space and time, and plenty of materials. But on my way up here from Watoga, I found purified water occasionally in supply caches and medical kits. So keep your eyes peeled.\n\n\n\nDassa Ben-Ami: If I boil water and that's mostly safe - aside from a teensy bit of radiation - what about tea? Most folks around here are tea drinkers, as you know. I recall many a night sipping tea on the stoop, watching lightning bugs and reading a book in peace and quiet. Tell me that's still ok, Kesha?\n\n\n\nKesha McDermott: Oh, bless your heart. It's probably as good as boiled water, anyway! Maybe even better if you add anything medicinal to it. Some survivors add all sorts of flowers and herbs to boiled water, and they swear by it. Personally, I stick with purified water. To each their own!\n\n\n\nDassa Ben-Ami: Switching tracks a bit, I know you're awfully busy with your latest research in Flatwoods. Can you explain that a bit?\n\n\n\nKesha McDermott: Of course! I'm testing local, natural water over time in Appalachia. Gathering data, monitoring the radiation and contamination levels, all of that. I analyze the data in my lab to look for long term trends, and use those trends to determine how we can use the water right now. We use the water for more than just drinking, you know. It feeds our plants which feed our animals... so we need to know how things are changing.\n\n\n\nDassa Ben-Ami: You've got a lot of work cut out for you. I'm glad you joined the Responders -- that data sounds invaluable!\n\n\n\nKesha McDermott: It is! I've integrated the data collection and research into the Responders Survivors Volunteer Program as well. I am still a teacher, after all.\n\n\n\nDassa Ben-Ami: Wow, and there you have it, folks. Thanks for talking with us today, Kesha. And thanks for showing us all how to live a little safer.\n\n\n\nKesha McDermott: Mhmm. Class dismissed!""}]"

Don't know if anyone'll hear this, but life finally took the last thing I had left. Figured I should leave something behind. I lost Joan in '77 and the kids in the Drowning, but I had my damned dogs. It's bad enough that the beast tore up the homestead. Ruined everything. I could've rebuilt, but it's not worth it without my boys. So if you find this place, I'm willing it to you. Just let anyone listen to this tape and they'll know. I took the last of my good chems for the bites, but the rest is yours. The last thing I'm going to do is hunt that ugly beast down and kill it before I go. I hope you have a good life here. But that monster flew off toward the Steakhouse... so maybe avoid that area unless I turned it into a fucking crater.""}]"
