	<h1><b>Our Mission</b></h1>
	<p>Videogames have always excelled at creating complex worlds filled with creatures, items, and that one mind-numbingly slow NPC you <em>must</em> escort. These games often have a plethora of in-game text that can be difficult to collect and read in-game. Library of Codexes sole mission is to create an archive of in-game text that is easily accessible, either online or offline (ebooks).</p>
