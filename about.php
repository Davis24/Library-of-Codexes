	<p>Library of Codexes has been around for nearly three years. In that time the website has changed in scope and design, but the core mission has remained the same: <em>easy access to in-game text</em>. With that in mind in the past three years LoC has grown from the initial 5 games to now over 59 games, which encompasses 22 video game series.</p>
	<p> This collection will continue to grow in the coming months and years. As the sole librarian, coder, and keyboard monkey behind the scenes Iâ€™ve been excited by the support people have had for this project. And I'm incredibly thankful to all who have given support through Patreon and Ko-Fi to keep the lights on. </p>
